Well,.. I’m back at work today. I now need a vacation from my vacation, since I got no rest the entire time. Luckily I only have today and tomorrow, then the four day weekend. Too bad I’m on call all week though. So far everything is great at the house, still have a few things that need to get done, but we are mostly unpacked, and I got a lot of the projects I wanted to get done, done. Now, I’m just waitin for my DSL to get setup, so I can move the servers home.
