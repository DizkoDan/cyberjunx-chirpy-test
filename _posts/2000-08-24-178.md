Another day, another dollar. I stayed up too late last night watching American History X. That movie kicked ass. If you havent seen it already, itâ€™s about a nazi skinhead (Edward Norton) who after killing two people ends up in jail. When he gets released, his perspective on things has changed completely.. etc. I dont wanna give away the story, but it was very cool. Check it out if you havent already.
