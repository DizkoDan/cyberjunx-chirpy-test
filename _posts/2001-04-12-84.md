Bleh!  
I am tired as hell today. I don’t really feel tired, but my eyes are in that sleep stage. I think it’s probably just my alergies, since I have been out of claritin for a week because my krakhead cvs pharmacy is never fuckin open. Almost the weekend, and supposedly it’s gonna be sunny and in the 70’s both days, but they said that this time last week, about last weekend. It rained most of the weekend. I really need to get my patio finished, cuz I’m tired of the big plastic tarp covering half my yard. I called a hauling place the other day, and they said they couldn’t come out till may. I have an enormous pile of dirt back there, that I sure as shit can’t do anything with. Oh well, that is all for now.
