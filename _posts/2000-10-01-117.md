Oh yeah,.. In case you did not know already, for the entire month of October all donations that we receive on **[stvlive](http://www.stvlive.com/)** will go to 3 cancer charities that we have chosen. Why? You askâ€¦ October is national cancer awareness month, both Steph and Myself lost our mothers to cancer, so it is a cause that is very important to us. Our goal is to be able to donate $1000 amongst the three charities. So if you have a few bucks to spare, think about it.
