s i g h  
I have been so bored with work lately. I have had a hard time getting anything productive done all week. I need a vacation. Maybe I’ll take a couple days off in a week or so, just to keep me from goin nuts. I plan on taking off over a week during the time that we move, but that wont be until the beginning of November at the earliest. I am really looking forward to it. I’m gonna get to spend time doing projects around the house. I love building stuff, especially when it’s in my house. It’s been many years since I have lived in a house, and I miss doing yard work and painting and all the other stuff most people hate.

Only about a month and a half to go….
