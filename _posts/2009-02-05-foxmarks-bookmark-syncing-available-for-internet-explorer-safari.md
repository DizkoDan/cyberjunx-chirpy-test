![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/foxmarks_ie_splash.png)Windows/Mac: Foxmarks, our favorite way to keep Firefox bookmarks synced across computers, is now offered for [Internet Explorer](http://lifehacker.com/tag/internet-explorer/ "Click here to read more posts tagged INTERNET EXPLORER") and Safari, giving anyone with multiple computers or browsers a pain-free way to keep it all together.

Foxmarks offers basically the same type of background bookmark-syncing awesomeness for IE and Safari as it does for Firefox, with a few key exceptions:

- **No password syncing:** A tough break, but not too hard to overcome by [using Dropbox as a cross-platform password syncer](http://lifehacker.com/5063176/how-to-use-dropbox-as-the-ultimate-password-syncer).
- **No [syncing bookmarks to your own server](http://lifehacker.com/software/bookmarks/hack-attack-back-up-and-sync-your-firefox-bookmarks-with-your-personal-server-235519.php):** Probably not a deal-breaker for most users, but we hope it makes a showing some day soon.
- **iPhone sync only for Mac Safari:** Actually, this isn’t a feature Foxmarks even offers for Firefox, so it’s kind of a bonus.

 If you’re still down to try out Foxmarks in its newest forms, head to the [Foxmarks downloads](http://download.foxmarks.com/download/all) page and grab your appropriate installer. I lack a Mac system, so I’ll be stepping through an Internet Explorer setup below.

Double-click the installer, accept all the standard “Do you want …” and “Allow …” prompts, and you’ll be asked to either create a Foxmarks account or sign in with the one you’ve got. After verification, you’ll end up at this simple screen, familiar to Foxmarks veterans:

The default action, if you simply hit “Synchronize,” is for Foxmarks to merge any favorites you’ve got on your system with anything backed up in your Foxmarks cloud. That’s fine for newcomers, but I generally like to get rid of all of the pre-loaded MSN, Windows Live, and similar bookmarks, so let’s hit “Change sync settings” and switch it up:

And here’s the advanced options, where you can change your encryption demands, force a server- or computer-wiping sync, and turn off that Foxmarks tray icon. Turning off the icon still lets you at the Foxmarks options from IE’s “Tools” menu:
