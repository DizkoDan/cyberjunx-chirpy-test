I’m in a much better mood today. So far nothing has happened to piss me off. The stupid workload is light enough that I’m not thinking about how much I hate it. Trying to work on some stuff on the servers, while I have the time. It seems like I have no time in the day. Work, eat, sleep. rinse and repeat.
