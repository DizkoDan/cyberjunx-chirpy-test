You can <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5140828/how-offline-gmail-decides-which-messages-to-download">search most of your messages</a>, draft new messages, and do pretty much everything you can do with Gmail while you''re connected to the internet.

When enabled, Multiple Inboxes displays up to eight different searches or labels next to your inbox for a king-sized dashboard of your email activity.

Tasks may not be a full-fledged app (yet), but it''s a great start. You can even turn an email into a task with a simple Shift+t keyboard shortcut. Once set up, you can <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5145357/add-gmail-tasks-to-your-firefox-sidebar">add tasks to your Firefox sidebar</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5144771/gmail-adds-tasks-to-the-iphone-mobile-browsers-and-igoogle">access it from your cell phone and iGoogle</a>.

With Go to label enabled, you can quickly navigate between labels from your keyboard in a similar manner. Simply type ''g'' (<b>G</b>o), ''l'' (<b>L</b>abel), and then start typing the name of the label you want to go to. Go to label will autocomplete the label, so chances are you''ll be there in a couple of keystrokes.
