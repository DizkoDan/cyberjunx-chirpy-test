Okay, so I know I haven’t written anything in a while, I’ve been busy. My vacation officially started today YAY! Yesterday we had our final walk-thru in the house. Surprisingly, there were only a few minor things that needed done. Like touch up some paint here or there. If my damn mortgage processor actually gets off her ass and gets things done today, we should be all set for closing on Wednesday. It will be a busy vacation for me, I am going to get boxes today. We haven’t started packing at all. Steph has done a little organizing, but no real packing. The movers are scheduled to be here Friday morning sometime between 8 &amp; 10. Before then, I need to move my fish which I am not looking forward to. Not only will the fish be incredibly stressed from being bagged for at least an hour, but it is going to be hard to salvage much water. 55 Gallons is a lot of water! I’ll be lucky if I can save more than a few gallons. Which means I will hafta add at least 10 gallons of water to the tank as right away, and fish really don’t like that. Well, gotta get this day started.
