Bleh!  
Back to work today, after I ended up taking yesterday off due to my being here till 1am on sunday. Got my car stereo installed yesterday, I feel like such a dumbass. My friend and I tried to do it last week, and we could not get the OEM out. We even called acura, and they were like, “oh you have to remove all of the paneling around the bottom of the dash, and there will be two gold screws” 3 hours later and a stripped down dash, no joy! This dude did it in 20 minutes yesterday. He was like, “did you try to do it yourself”? I said “yeah” he’s like “I saw the pry marks”. hehe oh well. It’s in, it rockz! now I juzt need an amp and a flyass infinity perfect sub, and i’ll be oontz’n my way through dc.
