![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/gmail_bigpic.jpg)Earlier this month we showed you Gmail’s new [multiple label-based inboxes](http://lifehacker.com/5147677/gmail-labs-adds-multiple-inboxes). Those turn out to be a perfect match for previously mentioned [GTDInbox](http://lifehacker.com/369590/get-things-done-in-gmail-with-gtdinbox), the label-based Gmail system for [getting things done](http://lifehacker.com/tag/getting-things-done/ "Click here to read more posts tagged GETTING THINGS DONE") in your inbox.

While GTDInbox was pretty handy for using GTD contexts and lists from within your Gmail account before, with the introduction of multiple inboxes, you can now put all your contexts on the screen at once. GTD practitioner and avid Lifehacker reader Jim sent us a screenshot of his Gmail inbox—a cropped, privacy-padded portion shown here—showing off just how great it is to have the color coded context labels and lists that GTDInbox creates, show in an at-a-glance style. *Thanks Jim!*
