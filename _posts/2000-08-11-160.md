Okay,.. so far so good today. I found a home for the second server. The best part,.. its gonna be in a rack in the same farm, actually like two racks over. This means, I don’t hafta worry about tryin to get a a port on the switch trunked to the correct vlan. All I hafta do iz pwer it down, re-rack it, and plug the same cables right back into it.

Unfortunately, I still hafta come in on Sunday night, but at least I dont hafta worry about whether or not other people got shit done in time. If all goes well,.. I am in and out of here in less than an hour. Though driving to and from will take me an hour and a half. Oh well…
