So I’m here in Georgia… I don’t have enough energy to make the trip downtown to try to find something to do. I’m just sitting in my hotel room, listening to Sasha, bored outta my mind waiting for Steph to get home, so I can chat with her. It turns out the dipshits who arranged my class, put me up in a hotel on the opposite side of town, and didn’t tell me what time my class is, not to mention booked my flight home for 7pm. This means I will likely need to leave the class early to fight rush hour traffic and return my rental car in time. Where are these people’s brains?
