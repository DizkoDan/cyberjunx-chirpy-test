So in a few hours, I’ll have 7 fewer teeth. I can’t sleep cuz I’m pretty nervous. I have been in bed for a few hours, but I got tired of tossing and turning. I’m really not sure what to expect. I mean, I’m sure I’ll be in a good amount of pain after it’s done, but I dunno if it will be much worse than some of the days I’ve had with these bitchez in (I did have to go to the emergency room once, and had a few other occasions that were not so plesant). But you see,.. I dont like dentistry at all. I like needles even less. My hope is that they gas the shit outta me before they do anything that involves a needle. Luckily, I will be knocked the fuck out during the extractions. They told me it will only take between half an hour to an hour for the whole procedure. It doesn’t help that I am extremely stressed out about other things right now. And what’s worse is I can’t have anything to eat or drink right now.
