Yeah… so it’s pretty damn cold today!

Friday night, we had our holiday party, and it was a lot of fun. Thanks to everyone that showed up. It means a lot to Steph, and we hope you had a good time.

I finally picked up my car on Saturday morning. I’m still waiting for them to get my aero kit in stock, then I’ll bring it back in for the install of it, and XM. The car is sweet! More than worth the wait.
