So if you haven’t noticed, I have a whole [new section](http://www.cyberjunx.com/blog/android/) here devoted to all things android. Since I’m using an Incredible, most of my info is centered around that device. However, a lot of the information is the same for other phones, especially the EVO, which shares a lot of the same framework. I hope people find it helpful. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know, and I’ll take them into consideration.
