I want my weekend back. Back to work today, though it feels like I never left. Got rid of the on-call shit this morning, so that’s a plus. Monday’s are my early day, cuz we take china to her d00gie class in the evening. I think this week or next week is the last class. We haven’t really gained much from the class. The book they gave us is very helpful, but in the class the trainer just follows what’s in the book. And I don’t like one of the other dogs in there, and china **really** does not like him. I still think the class was worth every penny though, because we have learned how to control some of her bad habits. Not much else going on. Bored at work, wishing I was doing something else.
