Appearing live in person, the fabulous Steph&amp; worlock! We will be heading back into LA late afternoon Sunday, from San Diego. The plan is, stay in LA Sunday nigt and Monday, then head up to Santa Maria on Tuesday. We’ll head back to the bubble on Thursday evening, then leave for home on Friday. So that being said…. Where’s the party? I’d love to go chill somewhere and knock back a few beers on the beach (Insert J here!). So holla peepz! In case you don’t have it already, my cell is xxx.xxx.xxxx. We totally expect to see you people there. If we don’t, Steph will come and kill you all.

That is all.
