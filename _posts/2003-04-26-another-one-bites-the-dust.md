It would appear that I have toasted yet another hard drive. And again, it is on my main machine. I am in the process of trying to salvage the data from the old drive, but I fear that a lot of data got corrupted by fsck when it couldnâ€™t read the blocks. With any luck, it will be okay. I just fucking rebuilt this machine less than two monmths ago!
