Last night was my last night at work. I didn’t do much work, nor did I stay all night. I got my shit all packed up, and left at about 3:30am. I’ll be starting my new gig on Monday, so I actually have a full weekend to get shit done. I slept about 4 hours this morning, so I shouldn’t have much trouble sleeping at night tonight. My goal today, is to get my desk built and my old one out of here. I’ve gotten pretty much all of Steph’s stuff done, so everything else is waiting for my side of the office. The new furniture really looks nice too, so I’m looking forward to getting rid of my old non functional desk. The only thing I’m going to miss is the amount of storage space this desk has, considering it is basically a full dresser (chest of 6 drawers) and 2 night stands. I have so much computer shit stacked up in these drawers. I don’t really know where I’m gonna put it. I’ve already sold some of it off, but I should really auction off some of it.

Anyhow, enough of my ramblings… How *you* doin?
