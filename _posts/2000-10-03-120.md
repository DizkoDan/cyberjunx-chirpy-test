Ugh.  
I fell asleep at like 7pm last night, and woke up around 3am. I got up brushed my teefz read some emails and went back to sleep. The alarm went off at 7am and I got up turned it off and got back into bed. I woke back up at about 7:25 I leave for work at 7:30 DOH! I havent eaten anything since about 1pm yesterday, unless you count the m&amp;mâ€™s I had late in the afternoon. I might hafta make a break for mcdonalds or something in a few.
