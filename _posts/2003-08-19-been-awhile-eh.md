So I’ve been kind of in a daze for the past couple months. Working nights makes you lose all concept of time. I have always liked working nights, but it’s one of those things that you never really get used to. I never know what day it is, not that I really care though. Things have been going pretty well. The job has been great. Rackspace kicks much ass!

Took my RHCE exam yesterday, got the results this morning, and I passed! It was actually harder than I expected, and walked out yesterday not sure if I passed. The sad thing is, the 2 things I knew would give me problems did. If I wasn’t such a lazy turd, I probably could have worked on them a bit more before the exam, and would have completely aced it.

Other than that, a lot of the same old, same old.

How *you* doin?
