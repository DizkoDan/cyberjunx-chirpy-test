So far so good today. Last night I had a little what are known as “sympathy pains” in my bottom row of teeth. It wasn’t really bad, but enough to notice over all the drugs. I am beyond happy with the way things are going so far. Hopefully it will remain this way. Still havent eaten anything that I hafta chew, only because I don’t want any food getting into the sockets. I would kill for a veggieburger and friez from red robin though 🙂
