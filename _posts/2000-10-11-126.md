Well, we took the baby bunny to the animal hospital to be cremated. They were super nice there, and very professional. Afterwards we went back to the pet shop. I didn’t think that Steph would want to get another yet, but she did. The pet store has a health guarantee on all of their pets, so of course it was free. Steph is really trying hard to give Big Bun a companion. Luckily they hadn’t gotten attached yet, otherwise we’d have a depressed bunny to deal with too.
