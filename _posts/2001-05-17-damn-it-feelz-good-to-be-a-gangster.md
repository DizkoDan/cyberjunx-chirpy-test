So I feel like I got a lot done last night. I finished up my legal nonsense, and have been working on a form that is opressing me. Anyone a form guru that wants to make me a very complex form? Aside from that, it’s been a decent day so far. The case load is pretty light, and I’m moving to another office this afternoon/evening. And hey,.. tomorrow is Friday!

**Update:** Okay, once again, Fucking telcoz can suck my fuckin nutz!
