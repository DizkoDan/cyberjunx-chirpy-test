Kindly suck a fart out of my ass!

How the hell can you not only not have common drivers for RAID cards, but then not have drivers one of the most popular NIC’s ever made?

Seriously.

I built 25 linux servers on the same hardware in a matter of hours. Didn’t have to change ANYTHING in my standard kickstart to make it work on this completely new hardware.
