It’s days like today that I wish I didn’t have any animals. I just spent the last two hours cleaning up after ferrets, and cats. It doesn’t seem to matter what I do, the ferrets dump all of their litter on the bottom level. It’s really annoying. I think I’m just gonna get rid of the litter boxez all together, and just fill the entire bottom level with litter, since that’s what they do anyway. Maybe it’ll save em the work.

Other than that, the weekend has gone way too fast, as usual. I got a lot of work done, but I’d like to relax some. I will probably spend the rest of the night working on [the site](http://www.serve-you.net) though instead.
