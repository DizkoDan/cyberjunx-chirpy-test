It’z finally Friday!!!  
This week has been long as hell. Not sure what all I’m doing this weekend. I know I am going to get some more stuff installed in my car tomorrow, and go get an oil change. Steph sayz I’m becoming a grease monkey, because I am always looking at stuff for my car lately. I decided that I want to soup up my car, and keep it for a while. I had thought about trading it in for a new one a lil while back, so I hadn’t made any modifications to it. Someone else, who will remain nameless (R O B), is callin me riceboy now. hehehe I don’t care, cuz my car iz gonna be even more smokin than it already is!
