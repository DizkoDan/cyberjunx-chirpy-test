On Friday, the company where I’m working my contract at, offered me a permanent position for substantially more money, and a shit ton of benefits. I of course accepted it, so as of Jan 3rd, I will be a permanent employee here.

In other news, I made the decision to get a new car earlier this year depending on finances. Since all is good on that front, I could have a new car as earlier as this week! I took my car over to carmax to get a quote, and they gave me a quote just over blue book, with all my after market parts still installed. I’m gonna try and get the dealer to match their quote, if not, I’ll just go sell it to carmax and cut the dealer a check.

I was all about the new Acura TL for the past year, but after test driving it, and the Infiniti G35, I am really leaning towards the G35. The TL has a few more bells and whistles inside, but the G35 has a lot more power, and tighter suspension. On top of that, I can get it fully loaded for a few grand less than the TL with the A-spec package, which is the only way I’d get the TL. So I’m going back to infiniti to drive the G35 again, and talk some numbers. If they give me what I want, I could drive out of there in a new car. Most likely I’ll hafta order my car though, so I may have to wait a week or two, but I’m so stoked! I love my teg, it’s been good to me, and I’ll miss it. But I’m getting older and I want something bigger that can still go fast.

Dolla Dolla Bill Yall!
