Well,.. another day, another dollar. Woke up very tired this morning, more so than usual. This 4 hourz sleep per night shit, has got to stop. I guess I’m getting old hehe

I have a long day of work, and talking to loan officers all day. It’s barrells of fun. They call Steph first, and she just goes “ummm, you should talk to Dan”. and gives em my number. They all seem fairly nice though, so I don’t mind terribly. Just want the money!

Tonight is the BT show! I am pretty stoked about it. If ya dunno who BT is, I’d suggest checkin him out. He 0wnz j00!!!
