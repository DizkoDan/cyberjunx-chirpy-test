We''ve gathered up your favorites here.</p> <p>Earlier this week we asked you to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5147537/best-lifehacker-code-apps-and-extensions">choose your favorite homegrown Lifehacker tool</a>. After reviewing the fruits of our in-house coders'' labor, you nominated your favorites. We''ve compiled the top five contenders here.<br /> <br /></p> <h3><a href="http://lifehacker.com/238306/lifehacker-code-texter-windows">Texter</a> (Windows)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/texter1.png" width="475" height="133" style="display:block;" />Texter is a robust text replacement tool. At its most basic Texter allows you to assign abbreviations for longer snippets of text you normally use. You can easily set up Texter to turn <code>sig1, sig2, and sig3</code> into various email signatures or any other block of text that you use with frequency. You can also assign a trigger key, so that the replacement only occurs after you hit the tab key, for example. That way if your trigger for your email signature is <code>sig</code>, it will only activate after you type sig+TAB, but not when you start typing the word significant. Additionally Texter has support for scripting beyond basic text replacement, allowing you assign keyboard commands to your trigger, like tabbing to another cell in a form. For a detailed tutorial on setting up Texter, including scripting, check out the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/238306/lifehacker-code-texter-windows">Texter homepage</a>.<br /> <br /></p> <h3><a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/trick-out-google-reader-with-better-greader-262020.php">Better GReader</a> (Firefox)</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/2009-02-07_175901.png" height="205" width="339"/>If the outpouring of votes for it during our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/390619/best-rss-newsreaders">Hive Five Best RSS Newsreaders</a> is any indication, Lifehacker readers love Google Reader.

The improvements are numerous, including: maximizing the article display pane, automatically adding new feeds to Google Reader (instead of asking if you''d like iGoogle or Reader); colorization of item headers; the ability to remove unread counts; mark all entries up to the current one as read; enhanced preview, and more.

Using Belvedere, you can assign sets of rules to monitored folders for handling the files found there. You can assign rules to move, copy, delete, rename, or even open files based on their name, extension, size, and creation date and more. If you find yourself doing repetitive things on your computer that don''t really require your input beyond being the one steering the mouse, it might be time to turn over the house keeping to Belvedere.
