![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/2009-02-18_124914.png)PropertyShark is an astoundingly detailed [real estate](http://lifehacker.com/tag/real-estate/ "Click here to read more posts tagged REAL ESTATE") search engine.

Enter an address into one of the markets currently covered by PropertyShark—it’s unfortunately a little coast-centric at the moment, without much middle-of-the-country coverage. If PropertyShark can access the direct records of the property it will do so; if not, you get a summary of the surrounding area using a nearest-neighbor system. You can review a dizzying amount of information, like the current owners, most recent sale, sales history, assessments, and taxes. There are multiple maps that show how the building you searched for stacks up against the surrounding area, how tall surrounding buildings are, how frequently buildings have been sold, and much more. You can also review charts of the neighborhood with all kinds of breakdowns, such as percentage of households with families and age distributions.

PropertyShark is a handy tool for getting a feel for the neighborhood before investing the time and footwork into actually visiting it. It’s a free service, based on public records.
