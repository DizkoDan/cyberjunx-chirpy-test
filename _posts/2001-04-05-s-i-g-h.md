The dns is is finally setup correctly! Only took them a week, 3 30-45 minute phone calls, and several phone calls. Now we just hafta wait for all the changes to propagate out to all the ISP nameservers. Now I can concentrate on more important things. like getting setup so that we can start taking some clients, and making back some of this money we are paying. **Anyone interested in web/mail hosting &amp; or graphic design services** [E-Mail Me](<mailto:dan@half-asleep.com?subject=Business Services>).
