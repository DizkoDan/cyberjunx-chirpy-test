Being on call sucks ass.  
Getting called when you are on call sucks even more.  
Being on call for a dept. you donâ€™t even work in anymore is the ultimate in suck.  
I have been called 5 times since I left work last night, I got a whopping 5 hours of sleep this morning. And I still hafta wait for a fuckin build to be finished sometime today. Im going to go shower now and get some breakfast. Maybe I can make it through those two tasks without being fucking bothered.
