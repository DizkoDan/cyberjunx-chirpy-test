Well,.. I’m back. The wedding and honeymoon were great! Back at work today, wishing I was still on vacation. The T1 circuit was supposed to be setup yesterday, and of course verizon didnt show. Allow me to backtrack… I got back from Mexico on Saturday night, and checked my voicemail. There was a message from verizon on 3/20, confirming that they would be out on 3/22 to setup the T1 circuit. Then another from the Tech on 3/22 saying he’d be there at whatever time. So Monday morning, I call CAIS and ask them about this. They say that they know nothing of verizon coming out on 3/22, and that the FOC date is still 3/27. So I wait around all day yesterday, and of course they dont show. I call CAIS again last night and tell them that verizon didnt show. They tell me that they will check with provisioning and lemme know what’s up today. Sure enough they call me this morning and tell me that the circuit was setup on 3/22, and that they just found out about it. RETARDS! So with any luck,.. it will be up tomorrow.
