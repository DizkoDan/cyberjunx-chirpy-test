Iâ€™m alive!!  
Had a really bad case of hay fever when I woke up yesterday morning. My allergies are so bad, that if they get slightly out of control I become very sick. My hay fever gets worse than any flu and it fuckin suckz. So, I did the only thing I can do in that situation: drug up, and sleep as much as I can. By about 3pm I was starting to feel better finally. I was even able to do a little yard work, without being bothered (no more than usual that is), by my allergies.

Steph and I are both going nutz trying to get serve-you.net finished. We are both under an enormous amount of pressure to get it done ASAP. Stupid legal shit is always the brick wall. With any luck we will go live Friday.
