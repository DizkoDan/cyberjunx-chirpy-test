Another Monday morning….  
The weekend was good, just went by way too fast (don’t they always). I stayed up way too late both nights, which of course means sleeping till at least 11am. Funny thing is, I still did not get much sleep. We went to the drafthouse on Saturday night, and saw Traffic. That was a damn good flick. I loved how it was shot. Went grocery shopping yesterday, it’s nice to have food again. Didn’t do much else this weekend. I’m still trying to get shit straight for the hosting site. Steph is finishing up the design, and hopefully it’ll be operational by the end of the week. She took a break and started the design for my radio station **[site](http://www.dollar25.org)**. I still have some work to do, but it’s at least functional now. Also, my **[station](http://www.dollar25.org/listen.pls)** will be featured on **[iMNetworks](http://www.imnetworks.com)** shortly. For those unaware, iM Tuning, is a new form of radio. In a few years, it will be just another radio frequency like AM/FM. In the fall, Phillips will be releasing the first computer free internet radio device, called the FWi1000 bookshelf stereo system. Only stations listed on iMNetworks, will be availible to these devices.
