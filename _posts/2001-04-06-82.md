Well,.. my drive in was actually good today. Aside from the fact that I’m on call, I’m glad it’s Friday. Hopefully I can get my patio done this weekend, or at least to the point where I dont have a big plastic tarp over half of my yard. It was supposed to be all sunny and warm the entire weekend, now the forcast has dropped the temps 10 degrees, and made it cloudy. We’ll see…
