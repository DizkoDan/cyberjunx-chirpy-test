Is the night over yet? We have been so busy tonight, that I’ve hardly had a moment to think. I got left with about 25 servers tonight. My team is awesome, so we have knocked out most of them, but I’m sure we’ll still be busy till the moment we leave. Fucking 1st shift here is a waste of space. They don’t get shit done, end up turning over all their servers to 2nd shift, who then get slammed since the majority of new servers pop in the late afternoon. Since they end up with all of 1st shift’s mess on top of their own bullshit, we end up with half of their servers. So it’s a vicious circle. If I leave anything for 1st shift, there’s a pretty good chance that it will still be here for 2nd shift. Hopefully things will get better in a couple weeks when we are making some “adjustments” to the shifts. However, I get screwed twice out of the deal, cuz I lose my best employee, and gain the worst of everyone in this organization. My only hope is that he either quits because he wont want to work for me, or he continues being a fuckup on my shift, so I can promptly boot his ass the fuck out of here.

Okay, nuff bitching. I have more work to do.
