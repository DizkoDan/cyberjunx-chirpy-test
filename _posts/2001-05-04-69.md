f r i d a y  
I’ll be takin a 3 day weekend, cuz Monday is my birfday. I don’t really care much bout my birfday, but I wont work on it. Finally got around to makin some callz yesterday. I’m goin to the acura dealer tonight to get them to fix my fuckin fog lightz finally. Then tomorrow I go to royal auto glass to replace my windsheild AGAIN. Hopefully I can get them to do it for free, cuz in July when they did it, They did not do a very good job. And I’m pretty sure this crack did not come from a rock chip, cuz it’s in a really odd place like right under a wiper blade, and I can’t feel the chip from the outside. I also talked to a landscaping company about coming out to finish digging out and leveling my backyard, so I can finish the patio.
