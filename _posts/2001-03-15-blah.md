Well,.. long time no write for me. Nothing really that exciting to write about. Two more days, and I will be a married man. This don’t mean much to me, since in my mind I have been married for a couple years now. For all of you bastards who aren’t coming to the wedding, we will be broadcasting it (very slowly) on stvlive.com at 1:25 pm on Saturday. Hopefully we will have a nice gallery of pics up soon thereafter. Monday, it’s off to Cancun we go! In T1 news,.. supposedly it will be done on 3/27. I am not holding my breath, but at least it’s a date.
