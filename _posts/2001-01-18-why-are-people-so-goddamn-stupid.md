If you get an email, and it has an attachment, DONT FUCKING OPEN IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS!!!! I am sick and tired of stupid fucking people shutting down mail servers because they can’t take a minute to look before they click. It’s bad enough that the dumbasses who write the virii exist. Hint to all out there, if you dont write vb and you get an attachment that has the extension of .vbs, IT IS PROBABLY A FUCKING VIRUS!
