For all the suck that my job provides, I have to try to remember that I have it pretty good overall. It’s about 11:00am, I’m sitting at panera (aka pantera), eating a bagel, drinking coffee, and working. The better part of my work week is usually spent at home or in coffee shops. As long as I have wifi, and a cell phone connection, I can work from anywhere in the world. I go into my office maybe 2 or 3 times on a good month. I think there was a stretch a couple months back that I went in once in 2 months. I spend a bit of time in the Data Centers, but not anything regular. It’s a luxury that few people I know get to have, and I am thankful to be in the position I am in.

Yesterday turned out to be a 16 hour work day (minus a couple hours for lunch and dinner). I got everything finished that I needed to get done, so in the end it’s worth it. And being that I’m the one who dishes out work, those who failed me, are going to have some rather unpleasant tasks to deal with today.

I’m trying to plan a “business trip” out to California, so I can spend a couple of days at the corporate office, up in Santa Clara, then head down to LA where my part time boss is, then down to San Diego where my director is. Since I have family and friends in LA &amp; San Diego, I figure I can get some time to hang out with people there, since it’s so hard to take a vacation there. I’d like to bring Steph, but she’s not keen on the idea of a “working” vacation. So maybe I’ll take 2 trips out there.

Anyhow, time to get back to doing work.
