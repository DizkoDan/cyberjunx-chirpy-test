So ummm‚Ä¶ yeah.

I don‚Äôt really know why I haven‚Äôt updated this thing in a while. I never have been good at it. Any how. Things have been going pretty good. I‚Äôve been busy with work, side projects, and life in general. Steph and I just got back from a short trip to Vegas. It was a nice getaway, and we got to meet up with some friends there. Unfortunately 2 of our other friends who were supposed to meet us there had to cancel at the last minute. So I‚Äôm just gonna have to bug the shit outta them to come visit us here in VA üòâ I finally got a new cell phone with a camera, so I setup a [moblog](http://worlock.textamerica.com/) on [textamerica](http://www.textamerica.com/). Not much there yet, and I need to customize it a bit, but it serves it‚Äôs purpose.

Wow, this got pretty long <lj text="click click"></lj>

10 months after I got my car, I finally got the body kit for it last week! I had just about written it off, and was going to just get the dealer to credit me the cost, and it magically appeared while I had my car in for normal scheduled maintenance. I am so through dealing with that dealership, and now thankfully I have nothing tying me to them. I wrote up a 3 page complaint about them, that I am sending to Infiniti consumer affairs. Hopefully they will break a foot off in some asses over there, so no one else has to go through the crap that I did. A new Infiniti dealer opened up in Chantilly, which is about 10 minutes from my house, so I‚Äôm gonna start bringing my car there.

I finally got my ass into the dentist a few months ago. I have undergone three 4 hour procedures to try to fix all the mess that was my teeth. I don‚Äôt have the total, but it‚Äôs been 2 root canals (in 2 teeth next to one another), gum surgery above those 2 teeth, somewhere between 10 ‚Äì 15 fillings, and a deep cleaning of my gums and teeth. I still have temporary crowns on the 2 root canaled teeth that I have to get replaced with the permanent porcelain crowns in a couple weeks. And since dental insurance sucks ass, I have paid several thousand dollars out of pocket for this after the $1500/yr dental insurance limit. Next year, I‚Äôll start work on the more cosmetic stuff, like trying to get my bottom row aligned, and some bridgework. The moral of the story kids‚Ä¶ **Don‚Äôt ever put off going to the dentist for nearly 15 years!**

In other news, I‚Äôm in the process of switching my phone lines over to Vonage, to get away from Verizon. I pay entirely too much money for phone lines that hardly get used. I‚Äôll be saving about $35/mo after all is said and done. In the process, I‚Äôm also gonna switch my alarm system over to a broadband monitoring service, which will save close to another $20/mo. I know it‚Äôs not as reliable as a phone line, but in the end, who‚Äôs to say either is gonna work when it needs to? We fool ourselves into believing that it‚Äôs actually going to help when/if the time comes, when in reality in most cases help is too late anyway. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, as long as the siren sounds, the alarm has done it‚Äôs job. Everything else, is just a bonus that may help a bad situation.

We‚Äôve been doing some work around the house, trying to make things more our own. It‚Äôs funny that we‚Äôve been there just about 5 years, and we had hardly done anything to the place. Granted, we picked out a lot of the stuff in the build process, but there were always a lot of things we wanted to change, like paint. So far we have only done the kitchen, but we are slowly working through the rooms one by one. We are both into a lot of asian/indian stuff, so that has been the theme. It‚Äôs amazing how much some color, or artwork can change the way you feel when you are in a room. I‚Äôm gonna try and get the yard landscaped in the next month or so, since it‚Äôs all dirt again. Feng Shui I say!

India, (our rotti/shar-pei mix) has been having some ‚Äúissues‚Äù that we are trying to work out. We‚Äôre trying some herbal (magnesium) treatments to see if it helps, along with task of trying to rid the environment of whatever ‚Äútriggers‚Äù we can. If the herbal treatments don‚Äôt help, we‚Äôll have to try prozac. I am not a fan of psychiatric medication of any kind, but if it helps to balance things out in her brain, then I‚Äôm all for it.

I guess that about covers my life the past 6 months.
