I am surprisingly awake for only getting 3 hourz of sleep last night, or this morning I should say. I stayed up way to late working on the firewall. I ran into a few problems with ARP, and ended up having to setup proxy ARP. I should hopefully have everything working tonight. Sorry for any latency you may have been/Will be experiencing on the web server.
