I was just talking with Steph about how weâ€™re gonna do our donations to charities next month. Since October is breast cancer awareness month, we had already planned on donating to that cause. But since both of us lost our mothers to cancer, I thought it would be a good idea to donate all profits from the site to various cancer organizations. Talking about it has made me sad though, cause it makes me think about my mom, and how much I miss her.
