Well, I got back into town yesterday around 4pm. The class turned out to be only about 3 hours, and completely useless. My filight was not scheduled till 7pm, but I was able to get on a 2:00 flight. Took me 45 minutes to get to my car and get outta dulles. Then I got to sit in a cluster fuck of traffic most of the way home. We went out for chinese food, then I went out to my friends place for a party. A friend of mine and I left at the same time, and were both booking up the toll road. I set off the alarm at won of the booths, cuz a quarter missed the basket. Oops!

Steph and I got up early, and drove up to get my amp and sub installed. While it was being done, we went up to tysons to try and do some shopping. We didn’t get much, we got Steph a silly monkey at build-a-bear, and we ate some fries. After that, we decided to go over to tysons II (a really posh mall). We went to fao schwartz, played with the toys, and managed to leave there with only about $35 worth of stuff.

After we got back, we decided to go to DC to play games at ESPN Zone. We had a blast there, then walked of to Fridays, to get Steph the firebites she’s been craving for like two weeks, only to find that they were closed early. We ended up coming back to Va. and going to Denny’s instead.

Now it’s time to relax. Is it really 2am already?!?
