ahhh….  
I am in a much better mood today. It’s amazing how a good commute can change your outlook on a day. It would appear that everyone took a 4 day weekend, cuz the roads were fairly empty for rush hour. Worked on serve-you.net some more last night, and figured out how I am gonna handle the forms that have been opressing me for so long. I know I said this last week, but I mean it this time, the site WILL be live by the end of the day. I have another potentially large contract with both development and hosting in the works. Anywayz, time to get some work done, so I can work on my own shit.
