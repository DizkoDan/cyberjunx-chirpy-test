![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/floola_thumb.png)Windows/Mac/Linux (all platforms): Floola, the go-anywhere, no-iTunes-required iPod manager, has updated with some nifty new features, including the ability to natively sync your Google Calendars to your iPod.

We’ve been into Floola for some time now, ever since discovering that it was the ultimate solution for [adding music and movies to your iPod from any computer](http://lifehacker.com/software/ipod/hack-attack-add-music-and-movies-to-your-ipod-from-any-computer-without-itunes-237986.php), whether or not you were down with iTunes. The latest versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux (GTK2 required) add [Google Calendar](http://lifehacker.com/tag/google-calendar/ "Click here to read more posts tagged GOOGLE CALENDAR") importing, plus a few bug fixes and optimizations sprinkled throughout.

As with previous versions, Floola 4.7 is a stand-alone app, and its best used by stashing it in the disk storage of your iPod to be run from any system. It doesn’t support iPhones or iPod touch models, however. It’s free to download.
