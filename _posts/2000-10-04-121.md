I am so sick and tired of my department. I am off in my own world here, unless someone needs me to do something for them. I am not included in anything anymore, which I don’t really have too much of a problem with, since I’m not into the whole “team” thing. But it really pisses me off when I have to go to meetings with the rest of the dept. and whenever something is brought up, I question why things are being done this way, when we know it does not work, and I get shit on. It’s always my bad attitude, god forbid I should actually know a thing or two about my job!
