IT”S FRIDAY!!!  
Well it is finally here. Long week, though overall time is really flying. I can’t believe that it was only 5 months ago that we had started looking at houses, and now we’re just a few weeks away from moving into ours. Tonight we are having our halloween party, it should be a lot of fun. I wish my friends from around the country could be here. We miss you guys! Now I must act like I work.
