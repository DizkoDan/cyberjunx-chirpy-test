![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/elisa_splash.png)Windows/Linux: Elisa [Media Center](http://lifehacker.com/tag/media-center/ "Click here to read more posts tagged MEDIA CENTER") doesn’t go in for swooshing sound effects or social networking. This open-source media center puts your music, pictures, and videos on your screen, period. See it live in screenshots below.

We’ve given [Elisa](http://elisa.fluendo.com/) a shout-out before, in our guide to [operating your computer with Wii controllers](http://lifehacker.com/5042254/operate-your-computer-with-wii-controllers), because it works surprisingly well. And it’s gotten a [shout-out](http://lifehacker.com/5102034/best-media-center-applications#c9278684) or two before. But we’re overdue for a look at how Elisa simply puts your non-protected videos, music, and pictures onto your computer or TV screen.

 Elisa is a free download for Windows and Linux systems. I couldn’t get it working on my Windows 7 beta, or (seemingly) activate the plugins in Ubuntu 8.10, but Windows XP worked just fine out of the box. Drop any tips, favorite plugins, or other Elisa advice in the comments.
