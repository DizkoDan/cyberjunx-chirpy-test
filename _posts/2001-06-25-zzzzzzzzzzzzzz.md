Another Monday morning,…  
I spent most of the weekend working on [**new forums**](http://www.stvlive.com/forums/) for [**stvlive**](http://www.stvlive.com/). I am very happy with how they have turned out so far. As always, there are a few bugs that I’m working on, ad Steph is still working on a few design elements. Overall though, it’s pretty much done. The members forums are not active yet, as I am still trying to figure out how I want to handle the authentication for access to them. I hope to have them working by the end of the week, but who knows.

I’m not going to be in the office all week, because I have a class to go to. I don’t know what I’m going to gain from this class, considering I don’t work directly with the product, but if my company wants to send me, I’m always willing to take a week off:of real work )
