I woke up at 9 today, oops! The landscaping people were out back using a power tamper in the pit they dug. I took off, and made it to work in about 35 minutes. I miss that commute. It’s so much less stressful, and I don’t get to work already pissed off at the world. Looks like a job lead I had is dead. The search continues.
