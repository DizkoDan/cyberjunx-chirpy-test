Ahhh…. BT was good. I’m completely over the whole club thing though. I don’t miss being there at all. Almost got in a fight with some dork. That was exciting. Now I am tired, and ready for tomorrow to be over already, so I can enjoy the weekend and try to get some rest. I am on call all week next week, which meanz I will likely not get much sleep :p
