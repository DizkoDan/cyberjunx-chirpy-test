I set this blog up originally a couple of years ago, and as I promised then, I didn’t update it at all. I was inspired by [Doug](http://www.onelittlewindow.org/blog/), so I decided to revamp this thing. I imported all of my old entries from LJ, though I can’t figure out how to get comments. I’m over LJ, which is apparent by my lack of entries in the past 2 years. I still read it fairly regularly to keep tabs on my “friends”, but I just feel it’s impersonal now.

I’m not promising that I’ll keep up on this one, but I think I’m gonna try. I always have shit to write about. For now, I have comments disabled, till I get things set the way I want them (gotta keep those fucking comment spammers out).
