Okay, I’m not sure how many of you know about this yet, so here it is. As most of you are aware, both Stephanie &amp; I lost our mothers to cancer. Recently, Intel teamed up with United Devices for the Volunteer your pc for cancer research.

For those of you familiar with SETI, it’s the same concept, EXCEPT… This is a worthwhile cause! For those of you not familiar with how this works, here’s the skinny. You download the agent, install it, and run it. You can either set it to run all the time in the background (very little overhead), or you can schedule it to run during certain times, or just have it run as a screensaver.

What does it do?? Basicly you are connected to another server, which then uses your computer’s resources to crunch data for the research. The only shitty thing, they only have the agent in wintel format right now. They just got out of beta testing last week, and expect to have mac and linux agents soon! So here’s what all you pc users with dedicated connections need to do: **[Go Here](http://members.ud.com/download/gold/)** to download the agent. After you install it, and setup a member name, **[Click Here](http://members.ud.com/services/teams/team.htm?id=935D8A10-5A89-4779-A35A-2B444129439A)** to join my team (Segall/Innanen).

That’s it! You are now making a difference that will hopefully save someone’s life. You can setup as many computers as you want (ie,.. work, home, school). There is a device manager, that allows you to label them.

Thank you for your time.
