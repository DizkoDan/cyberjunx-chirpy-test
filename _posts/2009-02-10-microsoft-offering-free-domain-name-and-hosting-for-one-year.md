![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/molsb.png)Microsoft Office Live Small Business is a [web hosting](http://lifehacker.com/tag/web-hosting/ "Click here to read more posts tagged WEB HOSTING") service that gives you a domain name (any available .com, .net, .org, or .info), email, business management tools, collaboration tools, and more, for a surprising price tag: $0.

Despite the Small Business moniker, the service doesn’t appear to be limited only to businesses—meaning you could probably use the service as a personal site (as CNET suggests). Check in with the [Microsoft Office Live Small Business video tour](http://officeliveoffers.com/demos/smallbusiness/intro/default.htm?nav=0&subnav=0) for a closer look at what you can expect if you decide to sign up. The service is free for one year, after which you’ll need to pony up a still-reasonable $15/year. If you’ve used it in the past, share you experience in the comments.
