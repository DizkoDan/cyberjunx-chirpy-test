Where did my weekend go? It went by way too fast. Seriously.

Not much going on lately. I’ve been trying to cut back our budget (or lack thereof), because we spend money without any regard. I had a real shock when I setup an account on [mint.com](http://www.mint.com) (which is a fantastic site!), and saw what our spending on food was over the past month. I’m not going to put it here, because I don’t like to talk about personal finances, but needless to say, it was a lot more than it should be. So we went grocery shopping, and have instituted a once a week dining out rule for the time being. My goal isn’t to cut out eating out, or eating things we love, so much as it is to budget doing so.

Started playing rock band a bit more lately (haven’t really been playing much the past few months), since I can never seem to play my real drums when I want to. It’s obviously not the same, but it can get close when playing on expert, and I get the same workout. I grabbed the demo of [Guitar Hero: Metallica](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q4HLFQ?ie=UTF8&tag=dollar25-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001Q4HLFQ)  
the other day, and it’s pretty cool. I’m not that into the interface Guitar Hero uses, but there’s no denying the killer song set they have in that game, so I’ll probably pick it up when a good deal comes around.

While on the subject of Music, some awesome new releases lately:

**[Lamb Of God – Wrath](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5Q6F2?ie=UTF8&tag=dollar25-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001P5Q6F2):** Love it! It’s no secret that LoG is one of my favorite bands. Metal at it’s finest. Unlike a lot of their hardcore fans though, I thought that the last album (Sacrament) was a killer album. I loved the obvious Pantera influence, and I’m not that big of a fan of the cookie monster vocals. That said, the new album is a return to the more aggressive style, and with it brings more growling. It’s not a bad thing, but IMO it doesn’t do the music justice.

**[Mastodon – Crack The Skye](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R4MEYS?ie=UTF8&tag=dollar25-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001R4MEYS):** Another killer album. I love these guys! Very prog oriented, technical band. Their lyrics are total cheese-dick fantasy stuff, but there’s no denying that their music is fantastic.

**[Static-X – Cult Of Static](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QWFUBK?ie=UTF8&tag=dollar25-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001QWFUBK):** What can I say, it sounds like every other Static-X album to an extent, and there’s nothing wrong with that.

From the not new (although they do have a new album coming in May), but new found love category: [Isis](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FIsis-%28Rock%29%2FB000APYO4S%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dntt%255Fmus%255Fdp%255Fpel&tag=dollar25-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957). I’ve heard these guys a ton in the past, even seen them a few times opening for various bands, but I never really gave them a chance despite rave reviews from both friends, and music rags. Finally getting into them, and I have to say that I feel like a total tool for not giving them more of a chance before. Awesome layered, ambient, metal oriented music.
