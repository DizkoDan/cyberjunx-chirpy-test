Well the inevitable happened. We lost power at around 11:00pm EST. My UPSâ€™ at home lasted about 45 minutes, then went down with all the servers. The majority of VA is without power right now, and itâ€™s not expected to be back anytime soon. Weâ€™ve been running on generators here since about 11:00pm. My datacenter engineer says that under our current load, we should be able to go at least a week without refueling our generators. Thatâ€™s pretty fuckin impressive if you ask me. Now if I could figure out a way to run a long ass extension cord the couple of miles to my house ðŸ˜‰ Wanna see just how bad it is? Check out these links.
