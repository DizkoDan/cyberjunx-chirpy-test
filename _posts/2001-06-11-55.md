Another Monday morning….  
I had a decent weekend. I took Friday off because of the bullshit I had to put up with last weekend, getting called 50 million times. My dipshit bosses decided that I had to use my own time off for this since “I get paid for being on call – not on call pay and a day off” Whatever! If I had the patience to fight it I would, but it’s like talking to a brick wall, since my manager makes no decisions oin her own, and is afraid to speak up about things. So I took the day anyway, because I needed the time.

I spent Friday doing stuffs in the yard, since I finally have a patio, and grass again. It’s nice, I can’t wait till I can afford to buy some more stuff back there. Friday night I did some site work, and fixed a few scripts.

Saturday, I did some more stuff outside, and I don’t really remember what else. Yesterday since I was actually caught up on [**serve-you.net**](http://www.serve-you.net), I decided to try and finish up [**dollar25 radio**](http://www.dollar25.org). I got a lot done, but I have a bunch more to do still. I am trying to do a cd store, and it takes forever entering all the shit into my table. Once I actually get a good number of em done, then I’ll break it up into alphabetical pages, and it will be posted. Last night we went back to Columbia, to visit Steph’s dad, and have some dinner. It was nice getting to see him, we never seem to have the time to make the trip up, even though it’s only about an hour away. It’s actually really close to my work, but I’d hafta drive back down to VA to pick Steph up then come all the way back, which is why we never go during the week.

Anyhow, I must get back to work, because there’s a shitload of cases waiting from Friday (go figure).
