![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/bitripper_basic.png)Windows only: If all you want is computer-playable video off your DVDs, bitRipper is the most simple, click-one-button-and-you’re-rolling solution we’ve seen. You can change your rip’s audio and video parameters, but you don’t have to.

***Note:** Many apologies for the [duplicate post](http://lifehacker.com/384268/bitripper-converts-dvds-to-avis-in-one-click), but hopefully we provided you with a bit more detail this time ’round.*

The screenshot above might be the only thing you ever see from bitRipper, if you’re not the type to fiddle with video codecs, aspect ratios, normalizing, and bitrates. After installing bitRipper and starting it, you can change the output file name if you want, but loading a disc and hitting “Start” starts the ripping process and puts an .avi file in your My Documents-&gt;My DVD Backups folder. Even our own [one-click DVD Rip](http://lifehacker.com/355281/dvd-rip-automates-one+click-dvd-ripping) requires a tiny bit more configuration on the front end, though it’s equally capable and simple in a general sense.

If you were the type to fiddle, well, here’s what you can get to with the Settings button:

And here’s the list of video and audio codecs you can rip any DVD track to (*UPDATE:* Turns out the list is dependent on what codecs you have installed, usually put there by other ripping programs. This is the basic list on a relatively untouched Windows 7 system):

There’s little else to say, except that it seems to work—I’m currently backing up a DVD from the default settings, and it claims it will finish at 8:30 a.m. (EST) or so, having started at 7:50 a.m. Speed demons can debate whether that’s my drive or a standard run time, but everyone else can appreciate bitRipper’s no-nonsense utility. It’s free to download for Windows systems only.
