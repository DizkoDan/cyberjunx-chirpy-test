Another Monday.  
Had a busy weekend. Went out to see the house, it’s looking great, Aside from the wrong counters being installed in the kitchen. Hopefully that will be the only thing that needs to be corrected. I dont want any setbacks, I wanna move in a month! After the house, we went out to skyline drive. It was beautiful up there, almost peak foliage. After the long drive back, we finally went grocery shopping (we haven’t gone in at least 3 weeks).
