So I’m still at work fighting a stubborn hozed harddrive. I’m hella tired, and a bit delerious. These movies have been floating around for some time, but I just cant stop watching **[this one](http://jb.dollar25.org/gijoe-porksand.avi)**. The audio is not really work safe, so make sure you put the headphones on if you that sort of thing gets you in trouble. The video is safe.
