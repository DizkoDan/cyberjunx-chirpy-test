Nothin like hitting up hard times cafe for chili &amp; beer. It always makes the rest of the day so much easier. I just realized this afternoon, that after tomorrow, I wont be back in my office for a whole 11 days! Now granted, I’m still working from home on Friday, and on call through Saturday, but I don’t hafta come out to bumfuck maryland everyday. Plus, I’m really looking forward to my cisco class next week.
