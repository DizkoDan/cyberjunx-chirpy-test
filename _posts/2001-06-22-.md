I haven’t been reading the news the past couple day’s, so [**this**](http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010622/ts/crime_children_dc_11.html) is the first I’ve heard about this horrible story. Not to get on a rant or start a debate, but I HOPE THIS FUCKING BITCH DIES! Someone needs to chase her ass around the house, and drown her in the bathtub. There is no excuse for her actions. I refuse to accept “postpartum depression” as a fucking disease. If you are “insane”, then you have no right to care for your children. They knew she had issues, she tried to kill herself previously, why the fuck would you let this woman take care of your children?!?!?
