oof!  
I am one tired mofo. My commute was long, and i kept feeling like i was gonna fall asleep driving cuz it was so slow.

I got my “review” at work about 2 months ago. I have been waiting for my raise to show up on my check, and to get my retro pay back to October, when I was supposed to of had the review. I open up my mail this morning, and find an email from my new manager saying “Please send me your employee ID number. I need it to complete your PCN.” WTF?!?! I wrote her back asking why she is doing my PCN, it should have been completed 2 months ago! What the fuck is wrong with people? You dont fuck with people’s money! I swear to god, ima go postal up in dis mothafucka soon!
