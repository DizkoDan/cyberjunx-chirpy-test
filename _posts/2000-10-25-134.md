Believe it or not, I actually don’t have anything to rant about today. Need to find out a real date for when we close on the house. I already setup the phone, and electricity, still gotta do gas. Based on my cross streets, covad says I “should” be able to get dsl there. Ima fill out the pre-qual forms today. Once I get a reasl date, I can actually arrange for the movers and kick my butt into gear and start packing and shit.
