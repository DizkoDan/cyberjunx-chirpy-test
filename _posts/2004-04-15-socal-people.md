If you can see this message, you are one of the few speshul people ðŸ˜‰ In case you didnâ€™t know, <lj user="punquin"> &amp; I will be in SoCal for a week next month. We will be arriving on 5/14, and leaving on 5/21. So far the plan looks like we will drive straight down to San Diego and stay there until Sunday evening, then head back to LA. We will stay in LA for a few days, then head up to Santa Maria for a couple. However, we want to see you all! So we are giving you the chance to help us set our itinerary between Sunday night (5/16) &amp; Thursday Night (5/20). When would people like to meet up, and where? While in LA, Weâ€™ll be staying in Burbank, and Iâ€™ll have a car for the entire week, so getting around shouldnâ€™t be an issue. </lj>

So speak up peepz! We are not picky about what we do, just want to hang out with friends we donâ€™t see enough, and get some good relaxation in. Steph has never ben to LA either, so sheâ€™d probably be into doing some touristy stuff if anyone is interested in that. Post your thoughts here, Iâ€™m pretty sure the few of you in this group are all still hangin out together on a fairly regular basis anyway, so it would be awesome if we could all get together!
