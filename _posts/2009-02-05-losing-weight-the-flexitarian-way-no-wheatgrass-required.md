The fix hasn''t been running, lifting, or anything trendy&mdash;I''m just eating less meat, and enjoying what I eat more.</p> <p>What I''m doing isn''t exactly new or original. You could call it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexitarianism">flexitarianism</a>, or a more regimented form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-vegetarianism">semi-vegetarianism</a>. You could accuse me of jumping all over the latest thing foodie guru Mark Bittman said or wrote, and, given how often he shows up in my food-focused posts, you''d have good reason to bust out the fanboy flag.</p> <p>However I came to it, I''m avoiding meat for all but one meal of the day. This plan has worked where a lot of other plans and diets haven''t.</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/burger_baby_01.jpg" width="250" height="184" class="right" align="right"/>First, a quick step back. I carried, in December, about 205 pounds on my 6-foot-1-inch frame. By all accounts, I''ve got a lucky metabolism, but I also love food&mdash;all of it, everywhere, in any amount&mdash;and dark, regional beers. And I''ve spent most of my career sitting down to write or edit words. So an excess of physique-softening, energy-reducing weight gradually accumulated on me, and it was defeating to think about. I''d read most of Michael Pollan''s popular eat-better-or-else books, and my family history is full of diabetes and obesity. Still, fast food drive-thru visits were written off with excuses about a tight schedule, vegetables were given the same respect as salt packets, and my sedendary life left me feeling pretty unfit.</p> <p>Most diets seem to be based around broad concepts (Don''t eat carbohydrates!), ridiculously strict regiments (any crash diet focused on one type of food), or lists of "good" and "bad" foods so varied and long that scanning a restaurant menu feels like a course in advanced database queries (next stop: South Beach).</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/food_matters_01.png" width="210" height="223"/>The diet suggested, or at least discussed at length, in Mark Bittman''s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1416575642/ref=nosim/gizmodo-20"><em>Food Matters: A Guide to Conscious Eating</em></a>, is simple, and centered around a rule a four-year-old can understand: Don''t eat meat before dinner. It might sound like sacrilege to those who truly relish a good meal, or foolishly restrictive to anyone raised on bacon with their breakfast, meat in their sandwiches, and a dinner plate with starch, vegetable, and entree. But for this Lifehacker editor, it''s an easily-defined, sensible challenge, and one that''s paying off the more I rise to it. It doesn''t punish you for dreaming of applewood-smoked pork ribs, it shouldn''t turn you into a waiter''s worst nightmare, and it makes it harder for you to overeat.</p> <p>Bittman''s diet suggestions stem from a wider-focused concern about the earth''s ecology, the food production demands of our modern diet, and other pressing topics of the day. If vegan, organic, or locally-sourced foods are what you''re into, a daytime vegetarian diet can certainly accommodate. But the weight loss that''s worked for me and the New York Times food writer is more due to how scaling back on meat&mdash;dense with calories, a great hider of fat, and easily eaten too quickly&mdash;tricks you into consuming less. It almost goes without saying that avoiding the processed, mass-produced meats in burgers, re-heated chain restaurant meals, and packaged entrees is better for you in any situation. But avoiding \any kind of meat forces you, or at least me, to get creative with your daytime diet, and makes the evening meal something you really want to enjoy, not just scarf down.</p> <p>Here''s how I''ve made a flexitarian/daytime-vegetarian/Bittmanist diet work for me as a day-to-day reality:</p> <ul> <li><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/antipasto_pizza.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="right" align="right"/><strong>Broaden your food base:</strong> Hide these from your friends with the "Meat is murder&mdash;tasty, delicious murder" T-shirts, if you must, but there are tons of great cookbooks, websites, and idea wells to grab meat-less meals or snacks from.

![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/wii_fit_normal.jpg)I’ve dropped about 10 pounds so far, and a little more falls off every day. The fix hasn’t been running, lifting, or anything trendy—I’m just eating less meat, and enjoying what I eat more.

What I’m doing isn’t exactly new or original. You could call it [flexitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexitarianism), or a more regimented form of [semi-vegetarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-vegetarianism). You could accuse me of jumping all over the latest thing foodie guru Mark Bittman said or wrote, and, given how often he shows up in my food-focused posts, you’d have good reason to bust out the fanboy flag.

However I came to it, I’m avoiding meat for all but one meal of the day. This plan has worked where a lot of other plans and diets haven’t.

![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/burger_baby_01.jpg)First, a quick step back. I carried, in December, about 205 pounds on my 6-foot-1-inch frame. By all accounts, I’ve got a lucky metabolism, but I also love food—all of it, everywhere, in any amount—and dark, regional beers. And I’ve spent most of my career sitting down to write or edit words. So an excess of physique-softening, energy-reducing weight gradually accumulated on me, and it was defeating to think about. I’d read most of Michael Pollan’s popular eat-better-or-else books, and my family history is full of diabetes and obesity. Still, fast food drive-thru visits were written off with excuses about a tight schedule, vegetables were given the same respect as salt packets, and my sedendary life left me feeling pretty unfit.

Most diets seem to be based around broad concepts (Don’t eat carbohydrates!), ridiculously strict regiments (any crash diet focused on one type of food), or lists of “good” and “bad” foods so varied and long that scanning a restaurant menu feels like a course in advanced database queries (next stop: South Beach).

![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/food_matters_01.png)The diet suggested, or at least discussed at length, in Mark Bittman’s new book, [*Food Matters: A Guide to Conscious Eating*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1416575642/ref=nosim/gizmodo-20), is simple, and centered around a rule a four-year-old can understand: Don’t eat meat before dinner.

But for this Lifehacker editor, it’s an easily-defined, sensible challenge, and one that’s paying off the more I rise to it. It doesn’t punish you for dreaming of applewood-smoked pork ribs, it shouldn’t turn you into a waiter’s worst nightmare, and it makes it harder for you to overeat.

Bittman’s diet suggestions stem from a wider-focused concern about the earth’s ecology, the food production demands of our modern diet, and other pressing topics of the day. If vegan, organic, or locally-sourced foods are what you’re into, a daytime vegetarian diet can certainly accommodate. But the weight loss that’s worked for me and the New York Times food writer is more due to how scaling back on meat—dense with calories, a great hider of fat, and easily eaten too quickly—tricks you into consuming less. It almost goes without saying that avoiding the processed, mass-produced meats in burgers, re-heated chain restaurant meals, and packaged entrees is better for you in any situation. But avoiding \\any kind of meat forces you, or at least me, to get creative with your daytime diet, and makes the evening meal something you really want to enjoy, not just scarf down.

Here’s how I’ve made a flexitarian/daytime-vegetarian/Bittmanist diet work for me as a day-to-day reality:

- ![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/antipasto_pizza.jpg)**Broaden your food base:** Hide these from your friends with the “Meat is murder—tasty, delicious murder” T-shirts, if you must, but there are tons of great cookbooks, websites, and idea wells to grab meat-less meals or snacks from.

This is, of course, just one man’s plan for losing weight, and anyone picking it up has to do a bit of research into what kind of meat-less meals are nutritious and relatively painless to cook and eat. It should be accompanied with real exercise; I’m just putting it off that part until spring because, well, it’s 12 degrees here on days like today. And results will vary, based on a lot of factors. But feeling good about what you’re putting in your body, and having a simple rule to manage it all, has worked out great so far.
