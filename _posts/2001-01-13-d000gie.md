I got a puppy last night! Steph posted a couple picz **[here](http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?itemid=1290499)**We have been looking at dog adoption pages lately, and saw that **[HART](http://www.hart90.com/)** was doing an adoption at one of the local pet stores. So we went to look. As we were walking up I saw china through the window. We had seen pics of her online (she is one of 5 siblings), and I instantly fell in love with her. She is half chow, half german shepard. Her mom was pure chow, her dad pure shepard. Not only does it make for a beautiful dog, but the shepard should help tame the chow attitude a bit. So far she has been great. We had a good nights rest, I woke up at 7 to her, I heard her making a little noise waking up. We went outside, and she took care of business. I was getting into the shower, and she decided that she needed a shower too, and ran in! I figured what the hell, now is as good a time as any to bathe her. It must be the shepard in her, cuz from what I have read, chow’s dont like baths much. We took a trip out to petsmart with her, to pick up some more stuff, and let her mingle with some other dogs. They were having an adoption there today, so ther was at least 30 dogz roaming around. She seems to have no problems interacting with other dogz, and children as well. Right now she’s curled up on the floor asleep, with her lil green monkey I got her.
