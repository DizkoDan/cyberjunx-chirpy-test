Guess what?  
After 2 months of waiting, WE CANT GET FUCKING DSL! Appearantly or lines are fiber, and DSL cannot run over fiber. So now, it looks like we’re gonna hafta dish out the cash for a T1. There are many benefits to the T1, aside from the price. A) no Verizon. B) T1’z are mission critical, so the SLA’s are much better. C) did I mention no telco?

GRRRRRRR!!!!
