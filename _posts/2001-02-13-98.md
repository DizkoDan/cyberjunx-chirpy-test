Bored, bored, bored. I am sick and tired of sitting around at work waiting for something to do. Not that anything I have done at work lately has been remotely interesting. I have spent the morning updating our wedding registries **go buy us stuff** at weddingchannel.com &amp; bedbathandbeyond.com. Still waiting on a date for the T1 we are hoping that it gets setup before the wedding, but not holding our breath. With our luck, the date will be for while we’re on our honeymoon and we’ll hafta reschedule it. I’m just tired of waiting!
