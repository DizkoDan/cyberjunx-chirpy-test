That’s right—Google’s rolling out offline browser access to appointments, and, for once, Apps users get first dibs.

If you see the offline link in red, hit it and, if you’ve enabled any other kind of Google [offline access](http://lifehacker.com/tag/offline-access/ "Click here to read more posts tagged OFFLINE ACCESS") with [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com), like [Offline Gmail](http://lifehacker.com/5140668/gmail-goes-offline-with-google-gears), you’ll get a familiar experience. You’re prompted to enable offline access, to install Gears if you haven’t already, and then a little green wheel starts to spin in the corner.

![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/gcal_offline.png)If you’ve already got Gears installed on your browser (supported on Chrome, Internet Explorer 6 &amp; 7, Firefox 2 &amp; 3, and Safari 3), your calendar will hook up its first event synchronization. Lifehacker received offline access this morning, and since our shared staff calendar isn’t stuffed with events, the first sync took less than a minute. Google doesn’t make it clear in its [Offline Calendar FAQ](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/static.py?page=offline_faq.html&hl=en) if there are any limitations to the number of events synced, backwards or forwards, but it’d be hard to imagine not getting everything. If they can afford the bandwidth to [give you about 10,000 of your emails](http://lifehacker.com/5140828/how-offline-gmail-decides-which-messages-to-download), attachments and all, it’s hard not to believe the simple text of ical data isn’t a gimmie for their servers.

Once you’re synced up, you get really basic options on your Settings page to manage which calendars you want synced to your account. Enabling offline access seems to only grab the default calendar on its first try:
