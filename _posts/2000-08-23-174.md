Ugh!  
My body is feeling the pressure of the lack of sleep, and excess stress. I felt like my heart was going to explode when I was coming into work.

For some reason, my damn NT Domain login at work keeps getting locked. Itâ€™s pissing me off. Of course IS has no idea what the problem is, so I juzt keep calling them to unlock it. I disconnected all of my network shares and rebooted, hopefully that will have done the trick. But hey,.. this is microshaft, nothing surprises me.
