Empower your Outlook with these add-ons, link-ups, and data management techniques.<br /></p> <h3>10. Never forget attachments</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/attachment_reminder.png" width="301" height="140"/>It''s not that it''s so difficult to re-send an email with the attachment you forgot last time&mdash;it''s just a bit embarassing to do it, in front of all those recipients. Skip the forehead-smacking with Lifehacker reader Troy''s <a href="http://mark.bird.googlepages.com/">Outlook Attachment Reminder</a>, a VBScript that checks messages for the word "attach" and its variations and then looks for a certain number of attachments. No attachments present? A little pop-up asks if you''re sure you didn''t forget something. Small, helpful, and great at keeping your e-name in good standing.<br /></p> <h3>9. Pin a transparent calendar to the desktop</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/outlook_calendar.png" width="300" height="186" class="right" align="right"/><a href="http://www.michaelscrivo.com/projects/outlookdesktop/">Outlook on the Desktop</a> is one of those little software utilities that are tough for headline-writing Lifehacker editors&mdash;the name explains exactly what it does!&mdash;but great for anyone who uses it. The utility embeds a transparent calendar with all your appointments onto your Windows desktop, giving you the same kind of at-a-glance awareness as those giant paper calendars made for the physical desktop you put your computer on. The app requires .NET 2.0, but installs it if you don''t have it already.<br /></p> <h3>7. Use Quick Parts for automatic text/image entry</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/top10_quickparts.png" width="267" height="156"/>You''ve explained how to grab files from the office intranet more than a dozen times already. Save yourself another pic-and-text time-waster with Quick Parts, an <a class="autolink" title="Click here to read more posts tagged OUTLOOK 2007" href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/outlook-2007/">Outlook 2007</a> feature that our own How-To Geek has <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5031083/save-time-and-typing-with-outlook-2007s-quick-parts">thoroughly walked through</a> as a serious time saver. Whether it''s a simple note about your new contact information or an illustrated guide to office refrigerator policies, you''ll never feel a sense of email deja vu again.<br /></p> <h3>Tweak it to be quickly, regularly emptied</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/top10_tweakedoutlook.png" width="286" height="177" class="right" align="right"/>Out of the box, Outlook is designed to make sure you see all your mail, not help you act on and get rid of it. Our founding editor is not one to leave things set to default, though, so she compiled a list of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/381966/tweak-microsoft-outlook-to-empty-your-inbox-faster">tweaks to empty an Outlook inbox faster</a>. Folders, toolbars, item counts, add-ons&mdash;everything in Outlook can use a little fine-tuning for a no-worry, on-time data flow.<br /></p> <h3>Kill your duplicate contacts</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/duplicate_contacts_scaled.jpg" width="168" height="120"/>People move, addresses change, typos are made, and the end results is your contacts list looking like a database engineer''s nightmare. Tech-Recipes.com has a <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2700/outlook_how_to_delete_duplicated_contacts/">straight-forward and quick system</a> for killing the dupes, and our Outlook-savvy users <a href="http://lifehacker.com/326818/quickly-delete-duplicate-contacts-in-outlook">dug it</a>. They also, however, recommend <a href="http://www.anti-dupe.com/">Anti-Dupe</a>, a freeware app that does much of the same kind of smart contact cleaning.<br /></p> <h3>Marry Gmail and Outlook the proper way</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/gmail_imap.png" width="250" height="165" class="right" align="right"/>They were certainly weren''t born under the same sign, but your web-centered Gmail and desktop-focused Outlook can live in astral harmony.

Perhaps you want to be out of the office when your message about the new coffee pricing hits inboxes. In those and many other situations, delaying your email sending can be a great idea. You can change the options on each individual message to delay a sending, as <a href="http://lifehacker.com/298782/defer-sending-emails-and-save-embarrassment">we''ve explained</a>, but the How-To Geek (this guy really knows his Outlook, eh?) offers a compelling argument for <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/microsoft-office/use-outlook-rules-to-prevent-oh-no-after-sending-emails/">delaying all Outlook messages</a> by something like five minutes.

But Microsoft''s integrated capture system can fill in everywhere that Outlook doesn''t quite fit. As explained in a <a href="http://www.blog.7breaths.co.uk/2007/08/managing-time-and-projects-with-outlook.html">7Breaths post</a>, OneNote can serve as the container for all the stuff that gets thought up, sent to you, and collected, to eventually end up on the "hard" Outlook calendar and reminder setup.
