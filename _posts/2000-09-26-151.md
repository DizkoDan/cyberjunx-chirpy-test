So far, it’s been an alright morning. Woke up and got out of bed on time, this is a plus. Stopped and got a donut and some coffee on my way in. Traffic kinda sucked, but it wasn’t that bad.

I forgot to mention that we went to see “Almost Famous” this weekend, it was a pretty cool flick, especially if you were really into the music during the seventies. The soundtrack was dominated by Zep, which just kickz ass, cuz they are my alltime favorite band. So I was inspired to listen to old music today. I listened to some Gary Numan in the car, now I will listen to nothing but Zep and the Police all day at work 🙂
