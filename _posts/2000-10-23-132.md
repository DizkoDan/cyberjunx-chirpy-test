Bah!  
Another weekend gone, Another Monday is here. Friday night, my computer decided it was not gonna run anymore, and took the night off. I tried to tech it for a while, but it kept crashing after like 2 minutes, so I decided to give up, and let it have the night off. Saturday I installed my AEM CAI in my car. VROOOOM!!! When I cam home, I started in on the computer again, I looked into the bios, and found my CPU temp at 175 degrees an rising fast! I rebooted it with the case open, and found that one of the fans on my CPU was dead. This is not a good thing when you have an athlon. They are run very hot. Even with two fans, they run at about 125 degrees, under normal conditions. So yesterday I picked up a new fan, and it was happy again. We went out to the house yesterday and came to the realization that weâ€™re gonna be living there inside of 3 weeks! We have so much stuff to do, like I dunno PACK!!! I hafta call the main office of our builder to see if they have a closing date for us yet. My guess is in about 2 weeks.
