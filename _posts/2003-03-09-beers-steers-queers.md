I have arrived in this shit hole that they call San Antonio, TX. It really hasn’t changed much in the 25 years since I left. My hotel is directly across the street from our Data Center, and next store to our administrative offices, so that’s pretty cool. We got in at around 3pm, and decided to go out to get an early dinner. After that, we wandered on the riverwalk for a little while before coming back to the hotel and hitting the hot tub. Changed clothes, and went down to the bar for a couple cocktails, and caught a little of the UMD/UVA game. Gotta get up pretty damn early tomorrow, but it’s all good. I think they’re gonna take us out to the alamo at lunch.
