We went to Sting (big candy raver event) tonight. It was all right, not really my scene though. I feel like I am an old man when I go to any of these thingz anymore. I dig the music, but not enough to deal with the huge crowd of underage people. It was free though (aside from the $15 parking), so it was worth it. Thanks to [Jason](http://www.jkrew.com) &amp; his girlfriend Jessica. Off to bed I go.
