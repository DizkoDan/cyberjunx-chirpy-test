![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/lh_home_binder_01.jpg)No matter how digital your life, your doctors, sports clubs, and children’s teachers won’t be at the same level. A “Central Home Binder” is a convenient, centralized way to keep all your life’s paper together.

Sue at the Unclutterer blog uses a simple 1-inch binder with a plastic cover to keep her family’s paperwork in one location—right next to the cookbooks, in fact. Here’s her other equipment and basic tab setup:

> The Categories (one per binder tab):
> 
> - Contacts
> - Health &amp; Fitness
> - Food
> - House
> - Travel
> 
>  The Tools:
> 
> - Simple Binder
> - Tabs
> - Plastic Pockets for In Between Tabs

As the author notes, even if you’re a devotee of your digital address book, unnecessary or occasional phone numbers, like phone trees for children’s groups and events, fit nicely into the “Contacts” tab, while the rest are self-explanatory. This system can be bolstered with a number of online paper templates, like the previously noted [Household Notebook forms](http://lifehacker.com/343657/create-a-home-management-binder-with-household-notebook).
