Went out to see the house today, itz looking great! After taking some picz and looking around inside, we went over to the sales office to take care of some paperwork. Much to our surprise, the paperwork was so change who we were getting our loan through, so that the builder would still pay $5000 at closing! Apparently, since we were turned down by their “preferred” lender, we still qualify for it. This is a huge weight lifted off of us, as we have the money, just would much rather spend it on other stuff once we move in.

After we were done there, I drove us over to Great Falls, Va. I have never actually been into the park in all the time I’ve lived in Va. It was great! We hiked for a couple hours, and climbed around like dumb asses on the rocks. I think I will buy an annual national park pass once we move, cuz we’re only about 15 minutes from there, and of course we’ll be closer to the Shenandoah Mountains, which are always fun to visit. Check out [Steph’s](http://punquin.livejournal.com/) journal for picz from both.
