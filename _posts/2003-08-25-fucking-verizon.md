Once again Verison has managed to fuck with my life. I am trying to get DSL installed (again), so I can finally get rid of the T1. The process was going pretty smoothly up until covad showed up to light me up. I ordered the DSL on 8/11. Had Verizon setup to install the loop on 8/19. Verizon shows up, finds that I have no free incoming pair for the new circuit. So we lay a temporary line from my NID to the pedistal behind my house. He does his loop test, and all is (supposedly) well. Covad gets scheduled to come out today 8/25 to do the final install. The guy gets here this morning, we figure out how we’re gonna wire this shit in, and get everything set. We test the internal connections we made, and all is good. Go out to the NID, and tap in. Come in, tone the line: NO LOOP! The tests show all kinds of irregularity from the NID to the CO. Showing on one side that im about 9k ft from the CO, and the other that im 13k ft. The error rate is sky high. Obviously there’s a problem on the loop. So this guy calls it in, so they can open a ticket with Verizon. He configures my router so everything will be ready to go whenever Verizon fixes their shit, and leaves.

So I decide to log into the router and do some tinkering. Well, this assmonkey changed the password, and didn’t tell me. So I do some searching on google, and figure out how to bypass the login, get in and change my password. The first thing I see, is that this jackass set my line speed incorrectly. Yes please, give me half the speed I’m paying for JACKASS! So I changed that shit, and now I wait. Could be a day, could be a week. Who knows with Verizon. On top of all this, I get a call from Verizon’s burried line crew stating that miss utility would be out here by friday, and that it would be another week or two after that before they would be out to burry the fuckin line! This being already a week after the temp line was laid.
