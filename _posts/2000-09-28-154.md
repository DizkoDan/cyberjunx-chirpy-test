Okay, so as of yesterday evening when I left work, I still had no confirmation on my class tomorrow, let alone any travel itinerary. I left an email for my boss asking if he had gotten confirmation on the class yet, so that I could bug the person who is supposed to be making my travel arrangements. I fell asleep right after I sent that email, and did not get out of bed till the alarm went off this morning. I checked my email from home, and saw that my boss responded saying the class is a go. Following that, was another email from him stating that something needed to be completed before I leave for my class today. Keep in mind, I still have no clue what time my flight is tonight, and I will have to stop by the house to get some things before then. Nothing like last minute arrangements.
