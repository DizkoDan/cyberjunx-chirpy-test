So I’m talking to a friend at about noon on Friday, and I ask him what his plans are for the first Virginia Tech game of the season tomorrow, He’s like, we’re heading down to Blacksburg at 3:00 today. I tell him he sucks, and he’s like: I got a couple extra tickets, you wanna go? Of course I do! So I drop what I’m doing at work, head home grab my toothbrush and shit, and headed out to his place to hitch a ride down there.

We got into Blacksburg at about 7:00PM, and went to a friend’s house down there where we would all crash. Once we unloaded the van, we all went downtown to get some dinner at [The Cellar](http://www.the-cellar.com/). After a few pitchers of beer, we headed back to the house and partied into the morning with everyone coming in for the game. After a few hours of sleep, we all got up around 7:00AM and packed up the 2 vehicles we were taking to the game.

One of the guys we always tailgate with works for a company that does business with [Wes Worsham](http://www.hokiesports.com/football/lanestadium.html), so he hooks him up with tickets, and parking passes whenever he can. So we had an awesome tailgate spot just outside of the stadium. We setup, had some food and some morning cocktails. I’m not really sure how or when it started, but it’s been a tradition before every game with this group to play “the big beer game”. Basically, everyone buys the biggest nastiest cans of beer they can find. Usually it’s a lot of crazy high alcohol content malt liquor’s. You get a few decent beers, and the loser is Zima. This time, someone found the most foul shit I have ever seen “Budweiser Chelada”, which is Bud &amp; Clamato juice. The game in a nutshell is, you pick a card from a deck, and whoever has the highest card picks first, then the next highest and so on. The loser gets the zima. I lucked out this time, and ended up with a fosters. After the big beer game, it was time to head in for all the festivities.

This was a very big game, not because of who the opponent was (who gives a shit about ECU?), but because it’s the first game since the horrible events of [4.16.2007](http://www.vt.edu/remember/), A day that we will never forget. The ceremony was very emotional. Many tears were shed, but I felt a sense of a new beginning. The school is so strong, and so is the entire community. I’m honored to have been there.

The game itself was less than stellar. Sean Glennon threw an interception on the first VT possession. It never got much better either. We won, but it wasn’t pretty. The spread for the game was something like 27 points. We won 17-7. In the end though, a win is still listed as a win. It will be interesting next week at LSU.

After the game, we headed back out to our tailgate and fired up the grill. Much food was consumed. Much beer was consumed. Many bodies were sun burned. It was a great afternoon. We packed things up around 6:00PM and headed back out to our friend’s house. We grilled up some burgers, then continued to drink through the night. Watched the USC game and finally crashed at like 2:00AM. We got up pretty early this morning and hit the road around 10:00AM. I got back into town around 2:00. Steph and I just got back from having chinese food, and watching Superbad. I enjoyed it a lot.

Tomorrow I’m going to attempt to finish mulching the yard. Now I think I’m going to go shower and relax in bed.
