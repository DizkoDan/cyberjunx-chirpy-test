It’s that oh-so-wonderful fuzziness in the background of photographs with a shallow depth of field and accompanying starry highlights. You can create you own bokeh effects with a little craftiness.

The term bokeh is an anglicized version of a Japanese word used to describe the portion of a photograph that is out of focus behind the area of principal focus in a picture. When you see a portrait that has a creamy soft background and a nice crisp focus on the person being photographed, you are seeing bokeh. The shape of the highlights—sometimes round, hexagonal or other geometric shapes—is determined by the shape of the aperture in the lens.

By creating a combination lens hood and cap out of black card stock and then cutting out the shape of the desired highlights, novel shapes can be created in the final photograph.

In the top/first photograph, the author of the tutorial photographed the same scene with and without the the heart shaped filter pictured at right. ![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/01/2009-01-29_223041.jpg)In the photo at left, Flick user [trazomfreak](http://www.flickr.com/photos/trazomfreak/3096709285/), used the same technique to create snowflakes.
