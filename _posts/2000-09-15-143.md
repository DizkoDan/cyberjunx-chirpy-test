Believe it or not, I actually got even less sleep than the night before. I was up workin on the firewall again, had everything workin great, then i noticed that Steph’z computer had locked up. So I was like, okay, this would be a good opportunity to change her over to the internal address. So I reboot her, put the new ip on it, the firewall saw her, Icould see her, but I couldnt ping out from her box. I am completely boggled, the firewall says everythingz okay, i could see her from an external address and all. At this point, it was gettin real late, so I was like fuck it, I’ll put her back on the external IP, and deal with her machine tomorrow. So I switched her IP back, and tried to ping the gateway, with no love. I was completely at a loss, and figured it hadta be an ARP issue, but by this time it was around 4am and i hadta be up in less than 3 hourz, so i brought down the firewall, and dumped everything back on to the external net. I then tried to ping out from her machine again, once again no love. Juzt for shitz and gigglez, I tried to connect her cam program to the server, and it worked! Her stupid fucking net utility iz broke ass! So chances are it was fine behind the firewall. I guess I’ll find out this weekend. GRRRR
