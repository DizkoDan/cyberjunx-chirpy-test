The list of culprits is familiar: overdraft charges, minimum balance requirements, and non-network ATM fees. The solutions vary from maintaining an actual paper balance book (shocking!) to finding accounts that can waive ATM fees if you satisfy certain criteria, like direct deposits. But the root of what blogger Jim is suggesting is something we’ve covered before—the power of getting more by [just asking](http://lifehacker.com/5127638/reduce-your-bills-just-by-asking).

What’s your own best tactic for fighting bank fees and charges? Which bank has given you the most fair and square deal? Tell us all in the comments.
