I’m not one for sappy ass “I love America” bullshit, but I do like to help out those in need when/how I can. Tonight, thousands of restaurants around the country will be participating in [Dine for America](http://www.dineforamerica.org). They will donate all (or a percentage in some) proceeds to the American Red Cross Katrina/Rita relief funds. Go to [their site](http://www.dineforamerica.org) and find a participating restaurant near you. You know you were gonna go out to eat anyway.
