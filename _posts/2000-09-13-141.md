So once again, my drive in only took 35 minutez! ðŸ™‚ It makez the start of your day so much nicer when youre not sitting in bumper to bumper traffic for over an hour. Iâ€™m tired as hell though, I get so little sleep during the week. I tossed and turned for like an hour last night before finally getting to sleep somewhere aroung 3:00, then got up at 7:00. I need to figure out a job that I can do from home.
