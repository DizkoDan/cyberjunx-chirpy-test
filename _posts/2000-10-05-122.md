w00!  
Today we get to do the pre-drywall inspection at the house. Hopefully weâ€™re still on schedule with everything, and the house should be ready by the middle of next month. My boss made me come in today, because I am apparantly doing some training. Well, I have been here an hour, and I aint done no training yet. Whatever.
