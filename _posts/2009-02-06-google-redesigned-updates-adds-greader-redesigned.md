![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/greader_splash.png)The crafty skinners at Globex Designs have officially released Google Redesigned 0.2, a [Firefox extension](http://lifehacker.com/tag/firefox-extension/ "Click here to read more posts tagged FIREFOX EXTENSION") that gives a whole-cloth new look to Gmail, [Google Calendar](http://lifehacker.com/tag/google-calendar/ "Click here to read more posts tagged GOOGLE CALENDAR"), and, new to this release, [Google Reader](http://lifehacker.com/tag/google-reader/ "Click here to read more posts tagged GOOGLE READER").

Here’s a look at each of the sites that gets skinned under the Redesigned extension (click for the even-bigger view):

Here’s what the folks at Globex, possibly headquartered in Cypress Creek, [have to say](http://www.globexdesigns.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=365) about what’s new in 0.2:

> - NEW STYLE! GReader Redesigned
> - Support for Mozilla Prism
> - Extension options dialog support
> - Support For Status Bar Icon Hide (activated in the add-on options dialog)
> - Optimized update system
> - Localization support for Bosnian, Czech, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish languages
> - Code optimization

Users with Google Redesigned already installed should see an update ping the next time they launch, but can also manually grab the newest skins by right-clicking the Google Redesigned tray icon and choosing “Check for Style Updates.”
