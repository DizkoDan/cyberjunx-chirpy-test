Bleh, another Monday morning. Hopefully something good will come out of today though. I am waiting on word from two lenders about the mortgage. I just want to get this part done already, so I can focus on things towards the actual move. I have been very reluctant to do anything, in the slight chance that we might not get this house. Once I know that I have a loan, itâ€™s all downhill from there. And on the plus side, bell satanik (verizon), has ended the strike 99%. Of course the slackers out in front of my offices are still striking. I guess this is because their regional hq is around the corner.
