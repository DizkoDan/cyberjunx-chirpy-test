So as most of you know, I lost my mom to brain cancer several years ago. Steph lost her mom to breast cancer. Every year (most natably in October), we try to do what we can to support finding a cure. When STV was doing well with memberships, weâ€™d donate the entire months proceeds, and even match it. Some years, we can afford to do more than others. I just found [this cool site](http://www.post-itstickupforthecause.com/). 3M is donating .50 (up to $100,000) to [City of Hope](http://www.cityofhope.org/home.htm) for each post-it filled out. It costs you nothing, and requires no personal info. I urge you all to go write a note, and tell everyone you know to do the same.
