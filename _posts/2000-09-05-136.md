Bah!  
Back to work today. I did not miss my office. Of course someone stole my laptop IP while I was gone, so the first thing I got to do was play the ping for open IP game. Then I find out that one of my production servers went down on Saturday, and our NOC didnt bother to escalate it. Luckily its only the secondary server, but if that primary went down, they woulda been fux0red. Oh well, their problem I guess. Time to go get some chili.
