So I went to see the oral surgeon today, to see what needs to be done. As it turns out, my mouth is even more fucked up than I had expected. I am getting 7 (Thatâ€™s right, SEVEN) teeth extracted on the 25th. I was expecting to get 5 pulled (4 wisdom, and one other moler), but it turns out that two that I thought were wisdom teeth, are not, and the wisdom teeth are impacted behind them. So I said fuck it, pull them all. On top of this, I still need to go to a normal dentist to have a few minor cavities filled, and the other shit you get done at a dentist on a regular visit.

For anyone who has not been taking care of there teeth, and has not seen a dentist in a while (read years), do yourself a favour, and make an appointment, no matter what the cost. I used the lack of insurance excuse for a long time, amongst others to keep myself from going. If I would have gone to the dentist even a year ago, I may have been able to stop the decay, and fix the damage.
