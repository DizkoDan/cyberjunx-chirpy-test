Okay, I know I am a slack ass, and havent written an entry in a long time. This is important though. Everyone go **[read this](http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?itemid=1278685)** now!

Now, about me…  
I have been busy as all hell lately. I am very happy that the holidays are over, since they take up way too much time and money. We are still waiting for the T1, I am waiting on a status update as we speak. We have been doing tonz of stuff on the servers in the downtime. Steph has been doing a major overhaul of all of the galleries again. I have been working on some scripts and other behind the scenes stuffz. Aside from that it’s been all about home depot. I am there at least once a week! I have done all kindsa stuff to the house, and I’m lovin it.
