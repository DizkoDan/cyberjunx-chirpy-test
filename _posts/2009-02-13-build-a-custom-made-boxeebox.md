![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/boxeebox.jpg)DeviceGuru blogger Rick Lehrbaum, inspired by the cheaper set-top boxes, made his own higher-powered “BoxeeBox” for the [free, open-source media center](http://boxee.tv). He posted all the parts, the how-to details, and lots of pictures.

It’s not a truly cheap project—Rick’s total cost was about $610, without tax—but it does result in a serious computer that doesn’t look bad in an entertainment center, has outputs for any A/V equipment you’ve got, and has enough muscle not to choke or stutter on really high-def stuff.

The full details, specs, and hardware list are at the DeviceGuru blog. If you’re keen on following Rick’s lead but lack the hardware know-how, our founding editor just posted a [first-timer’s guide to building a computer from scratch](http://lifehacker.com/5151369/the-first+timers-guide-to-building-a-computer-from-scratch) that can help you along.
