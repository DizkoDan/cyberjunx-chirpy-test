Just upgraded to wordpress 2.5. Love the new management interface vs the old hard to navigate one. Not much difference that I can tell yet on the end user side though.

In other news, I was reading [this article](http://lifehacker.com/374855/best-instant-messenger) the other day on [lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) asking people their thoughts on what the best IM client is. I was totally expecting everyone would say [pidgin](http://pidgin.im), or even trillian (bleh) and quite a few did. But I was surprised to see a ton of people saying [digsby](http://www.digsby.com) for windows. So I checked out their page, and WOW! I immediately downloaded it and configured it on my laptop. I was truly impressed by it even in it’s beta state. It is a major memory whore (70 – 100 MB), but I’ve been using firefox for years, and nothing comes close to it’s memory usage after a day or 2 running.

The coolest features it has over pidgin are integration with email and social networking sites, and that it stores preferences on their server, so when you make changes to the client on one computer, when you use the client on another computer, it knows about everything. If you use IM a lot, and you use [twitter](http://twitter.com), gmail, etc on windows, I strongly recommend checking it out.
