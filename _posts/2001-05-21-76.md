I had a pretty good weekend. I got a shitload of work done on the site, even got that form working (though I still have to add a few functions to it). Just a few minor adjustments to make and the site should be ready to go live later on today. Unfortunately, that is about all I did this weekend. There’s a ton of stuff I need to do around the house. You’d think that since Steph is home all day now that she’d have more free time to get stuff done. This is so not the case! I’m sure she’ll have a lot more time starting this week, since my slave drivin ass (as she put’s it) won’t be making her work on my site in her free time. I am waiting to here from the landscaper’s today, to find out when they are gonna be able to come out and finish the patio job. I decided to just let them do the whole thing, since the price it would cost me to have them just do the excavation, and hauling, was over half the cost to finish it off including materials. I can’t wait to have it done so we can get the rest of the backyard lookin good. China is killing all the grass out there from peeing on it. I need to figure out if theres something to help avoid it. I dont remember my grass being dead when I had dog’s before.
