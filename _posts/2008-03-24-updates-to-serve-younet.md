Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of work on my [hosting company](http://www.serve-you.net) over the past week. This weekend I decided that my shared hosting plans werenâ€™t competitive enough anymore, so I jacked up all of the plans quite a bit. I also decided itâ€™s time to start selling [Virtual Private Server](http://www.serve-you.net/vps.php) packages now, since the technology is rock solid. Iâ€™ve had one for several months now (this domain is actually hosted on it along with the rest of our personal domains), and itâ€™s been awesome. It replaced a dedicated server, and the performance has been way better.

I love technology! Iâ€™m always amazed at how quickly things progress. When I started [serve-you.net](http://www.serve-you.net) back in 2001, my biggest hosting plan was 500 MB of disk space. Now thatâ€™s my smallest plan. The fact that any monkey can setup a blog with a couple of clicks. Or even some more complex software. It just blows me away. I just wish I got rich off of it ðŸ˜‰
