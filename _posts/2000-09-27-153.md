Well,.. I found out yesterday that I hafta go to Atlanta tomorrow night. Oh Joy! I don’t mind going, in fact I am happy to get to, since it is for a class. But it suckz that A) it’s on such short notice, and B) it’s only for Friday, which means I’m there for less than 24 hours. If my boss was smart, he woulda sent me there today through Friday, since there is a 2 day class for the other part of the program that I need to work with. Whatever… I don’t question such things anymore.
