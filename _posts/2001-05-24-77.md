ARGGGHHH!!!!  
I can’t take this shit much longer. I had a pleasant 1 hour &amp; 25 minute commute this morning. Did not see a single accident, I have no idea why it was so bad. I am so bitter about this job right now. Everytime things look like they might be getting better, and worth the commute, they find another way to shit on me. I can’t believe that with all the tech industry around my house, I can’t find a single fucking job. I keep submitting my resume, but I get no love. Oh, and on top of my shitty morning, I found out last night that the person who was supposed to be taking my ferrets, neglected to ask the people she lived with before saying that she would take them. Not that this comes as any surprise to me, as everyone who has shown intrest in them, has ended up flaking out right before they were supposed to pick them up. So I guess they’re heading off to a rescue. I hate to do it, but I have held on to them WAY longer than I wanted. They are not being taken care of the way that they should. Anyways, if anyone want’s them, please let me know ASAP, cuz they are outta here as early as this weekend otherwise.
