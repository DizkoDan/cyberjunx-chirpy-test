So last night I was flossing my teeth, and I got to one next to my 2 temporary crowns. You aren’t supposed to floss them, but I always have (I’ve had temporary crowns on 2 teeth for the past 2 months). I’m just careful not to put too much pressure. Anyhow, I put the floss in and start to gently clean, and POP!, crown falls on my tougue! FUCK! I say.

So this morning I call my dentist, and tell her what’s up. I’m not supposed to go in for my permanent porcelean crowns until Oct. 2. She tells me that my crowns arrived from the lab yesterday so I’m in luck. Would I like to come in today to get them put in? HELL YES I WOULD!

So I drop everything at work, and drive up to the dentist. She pops out the remaining temporary crown, and starts my polishing. About an hour later, I had two new teef! I’ve had about half a tooth on each of them for easily 2 years now. It is so nice to actually have full teef there now. Aside from the slight pain I’m starting to feel from the needle going into my socket, and the packing of the two crowns next to one another.

So I’m pretty much “done” at the dentist. I still want to get some more cosmetic stuff done, but no hurry on that. My dentist put me on a 3 month cleaning schedule, since my mouth is still a warzone, and I seem to get more buildup than most.
