![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/printable-checklist.png)Web site Printable Checklist is a stripped down checklist creator that makes building quick, printer-friendly custom checklists a breeze.

To start off, I should point out that I created Printable Checklist a couple of nights ago after I got annoyed with my terrible handwriting. Printable Checklist is nothing special. It’s a single page that uses a little HTML and JavaScript to build simple printable checklists. So what’s the point?

I, like [many Lifehacker readers](http://lifehacker.com/399985/five-best-to+do-list-managers), prefer simple pen and paper for most of my to-do list management. I love web-based to-do managers, but if I’m being honest, most of my daily to-dos are written down on a fresh piece of paper when I start the day. I also have horrible handwriting and am unskilled at creating checklists that look and feel like something you’d actually *want* to consult. With Printable Checklist, I can quickly create and print out clean and simple disposable checklists that I can consult throughout the day, and I still get the satisfaction of checking off a large box whenever I complete a to-do. It’s also perfect for creating a quick paper checklist for someone else without requiring them to suffer through your horrible handwriting.

The site doesn’t require any registration, but the downside to that is that the checklists are also very much disposable. If you wanted to save a checklist, I’d recommend printing your checklist as a PDF (on Windows, [previously mentioned PDFCreator](http://lifehacker.com/software/pdf/download-of-the-day-pdfcreator-windows-251080.php) is a popular choice for this).
