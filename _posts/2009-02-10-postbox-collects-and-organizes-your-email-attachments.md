Think of it as Thunderbird with a file-managing fixation.</p> <p>In fact, Postbox is based on at least a good chunk of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>''s code, and most of its company''s founders and lead developers worked on Thunderbird or other <a class="autolink" title="Click here to read more posts tagged EMAIL APPS" href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/email-apps/">email apps</a> at Netscape or Mozilla. If you''re already a user of the open-source bird, Postbox should be strikingly familiar, but Postbox can also be picked up pretty easily by any new user. Let''s take a look around:</p> <p>Like Thunderbird, Postbox can handle RSS and newsgroup subscriptions in addition to email, but the mail is what it''s really all about. You''ll want to have an email account with IMAP abilities to get the most from Postbox&mdash;in other words, to get back through your mail history and grab pictures, attachments, and the like. Gmail and Yahoo Plus users get automated setups, but any account will do:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/postbox1.png" class="center" width="559" height="400" style="display:block;" /><br /></p> <p>After filling in the usual address/user/pass details, Postbox will connect and start acting like a normal desktop mail client. By default, it will only connect to your mail server and start downloading and indexing mail when your system is idle, but you can head to Tools, then Index All Messages to get the rich search ball rolling. If you''ve been using a webmail account that discourages deletion, be prepared for a bit of a wait:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/postbox5.png" class="center" width="499" height="144" style="display:block;" /><br /></p> <p>Whichever indexing route you go, Postbox looks pretty familiar in its standard inbox view. Notable, though, are the easily tabbed views, the "Topics" (like labels for Gmail), and an integrated search bar that supports Firefox-like plugins:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/postbox_inbox.png" width="804" height="522" style="display:block;float:none;" /><br /></p> <p>Your search options are pretty robust in Postbox, letting you combine multiple criteria to search on any folder:</p> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/postbox2.png" class="center" width="466" height="369" style="display:block;" /><br /></p> <p>When composing, replying, or forwarding mail, you assign topics from a keyboard shorcut or the prominent button.

The To-Do button lets you add a message to, well, a built-in To-Do list, and offers a neat, GTD-friendly "Pending" option that marks a message as needing a reply.

![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/postbox_splash.png)Windows/Mac: Postbox is an email client that helps you re-discover all the photos, attachments, and links buried in your email, as well as organize newer mail. Think of it as Thunderbird with a file-managing fixation.

In fact, Postbox is based on at least a good chunk of [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/)‘s code, and most of its company’s founders and lead developers worked on Thunderbird or other [email apps](http://lifehacker.com/tag/email-apps/ "Click here to read more posts tagged EMAIL APPS") at Netscape or Mozilla. If you’re already a user of the open-source bird, Postbox should be strikingly familiar, but Postbox can also be picked up pretty easily by any new user. Let’s take a look around:

Like Thunderbird, Postbox can handle RSS and newsgroup subscriptions in addition to email, but the mail is what it’s really all about. You’ll want to have an email account with IMAP abilities to get the most from Postbox—in other words, to get back through your mail history and grab pictures, attachments, and the like. Gmail and Yahoo Plus users get automated setups, but any account will do:

Whichever indexing route you go, Postbox looks pretty familiar in its standard inbox view. Notable, though, are the easily tabbed views, the “Topics” (like labels for Gmail), and an integrated search bar that supports Firefox-like plugins:

Your search options are pretty robust in Postbox, letting you combine multiple criteria to search on any folder:

When composing, replying, or forwarding mail, you assign topics from a keyboard shorcut or the prominent button. It auto-completes, suggests your most-used topics, and lets you automatically add a topic to your “Favorites” sidebar:

Okay, onto the neat stuff. Once it has run through some or all of your account’s messages, Postbox gives you some pretty powerful search options. Choose a folder, topic, or account, click one of the media type buttons—Images, Attachments, Links, or Contacts—and enter some search juice into the upper-right bar. In Images mode, you can sort by relevance or date, scale the thumbnail sizes *a la* Picasa, upload selected pictures to Picasa Web Albums, and, of course, save and send what you find. For those with inboxes that stretch many years, Postbox can be a time-sucking memory trip:

The view’s much the same for attachments:

And links and contacts:

Right-clicking on a search result also offers contextual upload options, as noted:

My one complaint, at the moment, is that I literally can’t find a way to see more results from a particular image/attachment/link/contact search—I get one page of results, and I have to find what I’m looking for there, or get really, really refined.

Postbox [features a lot more](http://www.postbox-inc.com/quickstart) than what’s posted here, but there are the basics.
