Okay,.. **[serve-you.net](http://www.serve-you.net)** is now up! It is by no means finished, but it is functional enough for me to go live. Those of you who inquired previously about hosting, please check out the site. Just a warning, and I hate to have to say this, but there seems to be a bug in netscape 6, not being able to run old javascript. If you use it, you wont be able to get to any of the sub menus. I tried to find a work around, but it just aint worth it, since it IS a bug with the browser that is likely to be fixed soon. If you are using this piece of shite, I am sorry, Iâ€™d recommend going back to 4.08. More work to be done, I look forward to your comments. Steph and I worked hard on this (even if her half is slacking right now :p).

**UPDATE:** It seems that I have found a work around for the NS6 java bug. Thank you sooo much Mike!!!
