Well, miss utility showed up on Friday to paint lines. Saturday afternoon, I found a bunch of guys in my backyard digging. I went out to see what they were doing, and how they planned to get the fibre to my house. We have a 4 foot wide stone path that goes from the side of the house all the way to the garage, so the fibre has to get across it somehow. They found a drain pipe that connects from my gutter drain, that goes under the path to drain the water away from the house. They wanted to run the fibre in that. I told them no way, you need to tunnel under the path. They weren’t happy about it, but they gave it a shot.

They dug a whole about a foot deep on one side of the path, then trenched it out and took a 6 foot spike and hammered it under the path. I sat out there watching them pound away at the spike, wondering how they planned to get it back out once they made it through. After about 10 mins of work, and digging on the other side to find the end, they just pounded the thing right back out. I was pretty impressed.

They shoved the fibre cable through, and pulled it out the other end, then routed it up the thin trench they made through the yard back out the fence to the box. We are lucky enough to have the junction box directly behind our fence. They ran it up to the side of the house, and bundled it up and zipped it to another pipe for the installer to connect to the box he’ll install.

The cable itself is pretty heavy duty. It’s about half an inch wide, and it’s flat rather than rounded. The ends are capped off with a nice thick cap to cover the polished ends.

All told, they were done in less than an hour, and left very little trace that they had been there.
