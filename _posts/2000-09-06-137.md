I hate coming to work during “normal” business hours. When I took this job, being 35 miles away through DC, I took it knowing that my “schedule” was 11-7. Therefore NO TRAFFIC! Now my new manager decides that I neeed to be here from 8:30 – 5:30. There is absolutely no reason for this, but whatever. Just another reason for me to not wanna stay here. For someone whom they say is one of their best people, they sure don’t treat me like it lately. Yet, when I say that I want to transfer out of the dept. or leave the company all together, they kiss my ass and tell me not to go. grrrr

Okay I’m done bitching (for now that is).
