Today I started my new job at [RackSpace](http://www.rackspace.com/). They are opening a new data center here, and I am a operations tech. Basically, I build machines, and fix em when they take a shit. Since the DC is not up yet, we are basically building the entire infrastructure (well at least enough to go live on the 1st). On Sunday, Iâ€™ll be traveling to San Antonio, TX. to do some training for a week at HQ. Itâ€™s pretty cool so far. Iâ€™m really excited for a new opportunity. The company is great, and Iâ€™ve admired them for quite some time. I dealt with a few people at RackSpace while I was still working with Plesk, and they were always cool. Making a halfway decent salary again doesnâ€™t hurt either ðŸ˜‰
