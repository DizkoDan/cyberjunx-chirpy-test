Saw Van Halen last night, and they were fucking awesome! Happy to be able to scratch another show off the list of bands I wish I could have seen.

Our party on Saturday was fun. Tons of food and drink were consumed. Marshmallows were toasted (and thrown at people at some point). Good times.

We got Guitar Hero 3 on Tuesday, and it rules! I promptly burned through the medium game, and had it beaten by Wednesday. Can’t wait for downloadable tracks to start appearing on xbl.

Oh yeah, I forgot to write that I also bought a new truck last week. I got a killer deal on a fully loaded 2008 Nissan Pathfinder LE. I love it! It gets terrible mileage, but so did my G, so I really don’t care that much. Especially since I don’t really have a commute. I haven’t taken any pics of it yet, but I’ll post some sooner or later.
