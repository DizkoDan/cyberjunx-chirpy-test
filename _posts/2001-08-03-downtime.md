I am about to start upgrading the hardware in the firewall. stvlive.com, half-asleep.com, and dollar25.org (including the stream) will all be down during this time. If all goes well (it never does), this should take no more than 30 minutes. If the shit hits the fan, it could be a few hours. I’ll post an update once we’re back.
