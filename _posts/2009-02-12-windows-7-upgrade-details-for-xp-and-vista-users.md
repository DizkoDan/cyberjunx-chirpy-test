Here’s a closer look at your upgrade options.

### Upgrading from XP to Windows 7

**Pros:** According to tech site Ars Technica, XP users can purchase a cheaper “upgrade” version of Windows 7, despite XP’s version gap. (Normally only users who purchased the latest OS get the cheaper upgrade option.)

**Cons:** [Windows XP](http://lifehacker.com/tag/windows-xp/ "Click here to read more posts tagged WINDOWS XP") users will have no direct upgrade path. That means that in order to upgrade to Windows 7, you’ll have to do a fresh installation of Windows 7 and manually migrate your files and apps to Win7—so you’ll want to make sure to back up XP before upgrading or just [dual boot XP and Windows 7](http://lifehacker.com/5126781/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-with-xp-or-vista).

### Upgrading from Vista to Windows 7

**Pros:** Unlike XP, Vista users do get a direct upgrade path to Windows 7, so your files and apps should migrate to Win7 without any problems. (You should *always* backup before upgrading to be safe, and just to hedge your bets, you may also still want to [dual boot Vista and Windows 7](http://lifehacker.com/5126781/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-with-xp-or-vista) rather than installing Windows 7 over Vista.) Vista users will also get the cheaper upgrade price.

**Cons:** It probably won’t affect most users, but the Vista-to-Windows-7 upgrade paths are actually limited by version in the following ways:

> - [Windows Vista](http://lifehacker.com/tag/windows-vista/ "Click here to read more posts tagged WINDOWS VISTA") Home Premium to Windows 7 Home Premium
> - Windows Vista Business to Windows 7 Professional
> - Windows Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Ultimate

If you don’t follow one of those three upgrade paths, you’ll have to perform a fresh install.
