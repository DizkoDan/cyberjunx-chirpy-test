Almost half of the hundred drives they sampled, purchased in random bulk lots, contained data that was easily recovered.

"I know they found a guy''s foot fetish on one disk. He''d been downloading loads and loads of stuff on feet.

Many people operate under the impression that when they delete a file it''s gone, as though they had torn a page from a book. But the way most operating systems handle such events is by simply removing the little marker that points to the file. That''s more like having information written on a chalk board in columns, each column labeled with a header, and then simply erasing that header to signify that column is "deleted" and available for future writing over. Anyone who looks at the board can read everything written in the column, until someone starts writing over it.</p> <p>What does this mean for your data privacy? It means a computer-savvy middle school student could recover a filed deleted in Windows, with little effort and widely available freeware tools. You need tools that will actually wipe the chalk board clean.</p> <h3>Secure Deletion and File Overwrite</h3> <p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/2009-02-14_140553.png" height="111" width="211"/>Overwriting the data on a disk with other data is a strong defense against the original data being recovered. There is an enormous amount of misinformation about the process of secure file deletion and overwriting, however.</p> <p>There''s no sense in wasting your time and electricity performing elaborate file deletion rituals that won''t yield you any additional benefit. An excellent example of the high effort/low yield relationship that can sometimes occur in secure deletion is the Gutmann Method. The Gutmann Method was deisgned by Peter Gutmann and Colin Plumb in the 1990s, and is held up by many as a gold standard for disk wiping. It''s also intensely time consuming and could easily take weeks to wipe a single modern drive of moderately high capacity. The image, above right, shows a screen capture of the 35-pass Gutmann Method taking fourteen days. Turns out the majority of that time would be a complete waste, as pointed out by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method">Gutmann</a>:<br /> <blockquote>In the time since this paper was published, some people have treated the 35-pass overwrite technique described in it more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques. As a result, they advocate applying the voodoo to PRML and EPRML drives even though it will have no more effect than a simple scrubbing with random data. In fact performing the full 35-pass overwrite is pointless for any drive since it targets a blend of scenarios involving all types of (normally-used) encoding technology, which covers everything back to 30+-year-old MFM methods</blockquote></p> <p>In other words, a user who wastes a week of clock cycles and electricity furiously scrubbing a disk would have been just as well served to perform a simple overnight scrub with a series of random binary code. <em>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joebeone/2240550570/">joebeone</a>.</em></p> <p>There are several methods for securely deleting files from your disks.

What does this mean for your data privacy? It means a computer-savvy middle school student could recover a filed deleted in Windows, with little effort and widely available freeware tools. You need tools that will actually wipe the chalk board clean.

There are several methods for securely deleting files from your disks. Institutions like the Department of Defense, universities, and law enforcement agencies have created standards for what they would consider adequate scrambling of sensitive disk data. We’ve recommended some tools over the years that cut the same profile, or close to, their methods. Below is a list of tools, arranged by severity and operating system:

**Total Disk Wipe – All Platforms**

- [Darik’s Boot and Nuke](http://lifehacker.com/5090567/dariks-boot-and-nuke-is-the-nuclear-option-of-secure-data-shredding) – an open-source boot disk utility (read: works on nearly any computer) that supports a wide variety of disk wiping methods and operates from inside the computer’s RAM, allowing it to scrub the disk thoroughly at a remove.

**Selective File Wipe – Windows**

- [Wipe File](http://lifehacker.com/395469/wipe-file-offers-custom-levels-of-deletion-paranoia) – Portable application that overwrites the specific disk space occupied by the file you’d like erased and leaves the rest of the disk untouched.
- [DeleteOnClick](http://lifehacker.com/307178/securely-delete-files-with-deleteonclick) – Integrates with the Windows shell, adding a “Securely Delete” option to the right click menu which engages a Department of Defense 5220.22-M overwrite on the files.
- [Eraser](http://lifehacker.com/software/downloads/download-of-the-day-eraser-125289.php) – In addition to securely deleting individual files, Eraser can be scheduled to perform regular overwrites of empty disc space ensuring you catch those orphan files hanging outside the reach of Windows.

**Selective File Wipe – [Mac OS X](http://lifehacker.com/tag/mac-os-x/ "Click here to read more posts tagged MAC OS X")**

- [Permanent Eraser](http://lifehacker.com/software/featured-mac-download/securely-delete-files-with-permanent-eraser-265730.php) – Although Mac users have had the “secure empty trash” option, based on a multiple pass DoD method, since OS 10.3, Permanent Eraser offers peace of mind for those needing more assurance.

**Selective File Wipe – Linux (Ubuntu)**

- [Wipe Package from Ubuntu Unleashed](http://lifehacker.com/346445/securely-wipe-files-with-a-right+click-in-ubuntu) – Adds secure multi-pass file deletion to your right click menu, like the aforementioned DeleteOnClick does in Windows.

You can never be too vigilant with your data.
