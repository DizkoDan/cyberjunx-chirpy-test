So for the past month or so, I have been actively pursuing a new job. I love Rackspace, and they have been good to me, but I felt it was time for me to move on and put my talents to better use. I had been contacted by a few people about potential jobs, and my resume is all over the place. A couple of weeks ago, a recruiter contacted me about a Linux sysadmin position that I might be interested in. I gave them a call thinking that they were gonna offer me some windoze admin job with a little unix/linux. Instead, it turned out to be damn near exactly what I was looking for. We finally got an interview setup for yesterday afternoon, so I went in on my few hours of sleep for the week, and had a nice long 2 hour interview with some of the other admins, and the director. They were all awesome, and I wanted to stay and talk with them even longer. They told me they were in a hurry to fill the position, and would decide soon. I got home from work at about 8:30 this morning, and they called me at about 10:00 and said congratulations! I received and faxed back my offer, and sent off my resignation letter this morning.

I am beyond ecstatic! I have been extremely stressed out at work over the past couple months. The hours were really beginning to tear into my time with Steph. So I will finally be back on a “normal” schedule, get an ass-ton more money, and do what I’m actually good at. I can’t wait to start!
