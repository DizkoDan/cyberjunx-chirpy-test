![](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/02/mint_splash2.png)Money management site Mint now lets you track all your physical assets—your house, your car, Aunt Gerdie’s brooch in the safe—along with your finances, giving you a rough look at your total [net worth](http://lifehacker.com/tag/net-worth/ "Click here to read more posts tagged NET WORTH").

The biggest change to Mint.com, the money management webapp we’ve [toured](http://lifehacker.com/391295/mint-tracks-your-investment-portfolio) and [polled as a reader favorite](http://lifehacker.com/5067943/mint-is-the-most-popular-web+based-personal-finance-app), is that you can now add any asset you’ve got, in addition to your cash and investment accounts, to the site, helping you determine your overall net worth. That might not be such an appealing statistic to have on hand of late, but it does make Mint a more robust manager of your monetary life.

The one apparent drawback to Mint’s asset handling, at least from what I see, is that there’s no depreciation built into it. Especially for cars, that could lead to a misleading sense of what you have on hand. Perhaps Mint will ask you after a year or so if you have a new value for your assets, but it’d be nice to see that kind of assurance up-front.

Check out Mint’s new features, including the opening of the (advertising-partner-driven) [Ways to Save](http://www.mint.com/offers/credit-cards/) area to non-account-holders, in the gallery below:
