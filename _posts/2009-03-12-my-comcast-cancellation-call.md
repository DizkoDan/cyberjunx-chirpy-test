So I called comcast to cancel my cable internet service today, and the conversation went something like this:

**comcast**: Hi, how can I assist you today?  
**me**: Hi, I’d like to cancel my internet service.  
**comcast**: May I ask the reason?  
**me**: I’m switching to FIOS.  
**comcast**: Why do you want to do that?  
**me**: Faster speeds.  
**comcast**: You know, we have pretty fast speeds available too.  
**me**: I’m pretty sure I have the fastest already.  
**comcast**: What city are you in?  
**me**: Ashburn  
**comcast**: One moment…. Yes, I see you have 16/2. You do know that you are getting a discounted rate on this service? You pay $56/mo, normally it’s $62/mo.  
**me**: All the more reason to switch.  
**comcast**: So there’s nothing we can do to keep you?  
**me**: No. I’ve already switched.  
**comcast**: Okay. You just need to return your router within 5 days.  
**me**: Thanks. Have a nice day.
