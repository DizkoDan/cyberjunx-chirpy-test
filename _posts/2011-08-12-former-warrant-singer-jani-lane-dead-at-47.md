<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">> <div> According to [TMZ.com](http://www.tmz.com/2011/08/11/warrant-singer-jani-lane-dead-dies-died-hotel-ventura-los-angeles-cherry-pie/), former **WARRANT** singer **Jani Lane** was found dead earlier this evening (Thursday, August 11) at a Los Angeles-area hotel. He was 47 years old. **Lane** was pronounced dead by Fire Department personnel who responded to a call shortly before 5:30 p.m. in the Comfort Inn in the 20100 block of Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills, California, the **Los Angeles Police Department** said.
> 
> The cause of death was unknown, and the case was turned over to the Los Angeles county coroner’s office, **LAPD** officer **Sara Faden** told the **Los Angeles Times**.
> 
> **Lane** was married three times and is survived by a wife and four children.
> 
> On July 23, **Lane** took part in a taping of an upcoming episode of the **“That Metal Show”** alongside **Michael Sweet** (**STRYPER**) and **Taime Downe** (**FASTER PUSSYCAT**) (see photos below). The program featuring **Lane** is scheduled to air on October 1 on **VH1 Classic**.
> 
> In February, **Lane** (born **John Kennedy Oswald** on February 1, 1964) canceled all of his previously announced solo tour dates two days before the first show was due to take place. No explanation was offered for the cancelation.
> 
> **WARRANT** announced in September 2008 that it was splitting with **Lane** six months after the band reunited with the troubled vocalist. He has since been replaced by **Robert Mason** (**LYNCH MOB**, **CRY OF LOVE**, **BIG COCK**).
> 
> **Lane** originally left **WARRANT** in March 1993 but rejoined the band in September 1994. The group went on to record the **“Ultraphobic”** (1995), **“Belly To Belly”** (1996) and **“Greatest &amp; Latest”** (1999) albums and issued and collection of covers, **“Under The Influence”**, in 2001. **Jani** quit **WARRANT** again in 2004 before reuniting with the group four years later.
> 
> **Lane** released a solo album, **“Back Down to One”**, in 2003, but shortly after was admitted to a rehab center for alcohol and drug-related exhaustion. He also appeared on **VH1**‘s reality series **“Celebrity Fit Club”**.
> 
> On July 19, 2010, **Lane** pled no contest to DUI stemming from his arrest two months earlier — and was ordered to serve 120 days in jail. In addition, **Lane** lost his license for three years and had to complete a 30-month alcohol-education program.
> 
> Prior to serving time in jail for his most recent legal troubles, **Lane** issued a statement in which he said, in part, “My true hope is that anyone out there dealing with personal problems… the consequences do not get lighter. I can only say I’ve never regretted a good decision or action and never been proud of bad ones. People have an astounding ability to forgive… I have to start with forgiving myself. That is something that I find far more difficult than I imagined. I think it starts with gratitude.”
> 
> In a June 2010 interview, **Lane** spoke about his battle with alcoholism and the negative impact it has had on his career.
> 
> “The last year, I’ve suffered some consequences from drinking that I’ve never suffered in my entire life,” he said. “It’s really made me take a step back and go, ‘Is this how you want to continue? Is this how you want to finish up?’ The answer is no.”
> 
> He continued, “I’ll tell you, one day you think that this is absolutely normal, this is expected, ‘This has been my lifestyle for 20 years, what’s the problem?’ And, all of a sudden, things take a turn, and you go, ‘I don’t like these consequences. I don’t like how this affects my family, I don’t like how this affects my career, I don’t like how this affects anything.’ Then you begin to work.”
> 
> When asked if his treatment involved going to a rehab, **Lane** replied, “I have gone to rehabilitation, absolutely. I know some people who want to be quiet about that kind of stuff, but I am not the kind of person who pride is going to win out over saying, ‘Hey, I’m honestly getting this in check and fixing this.’ It is a very important thing to me. I mean, this just doesn’t affect me like it used to. It affects everything in my life, including the people I love. To be honest, I get tired of giving ammo to the people who don’t wish me well.”

His passing has shocked and saddened me to the point of tears. A great person whose talent was far greater than most people will ever know. I produced a number of songs for his solo project in the late ’90s. My connection with **Jani** as artist and producer was textbook perfect. Upon completion of those sessions, we both said it was a mind-blowing experience to work together and we would do it again, \[and\] we did. The world will truly miss **Jani Lane**. I’m so lucky to have been a small part of his life. RIP **Jani**. I’m numb!!”

> 
> **Kelly Hansen** (**FOREIGNER**): “So very sad about the passing of **Jani Lane**. We came up at the same time. I’ll remember his voice. My heart goes out to his family &amp; fans.”

It’s safe to say we Huluds weren’t necessarily **WARRANT** fans, but we respect **Jani**‘s talents, and his honesty about his pursuit of sobriety. Our condolences to his family, friends, and fans.”
> 
> **DJ Ashba** (**GUNS N’ ROSES**, **SIXX: A.M.**): “It’s sad that sometimes it takes someone you know to lose their life to put yours into perspective, It’s funny how life is so easily taken for granted sometimes. I think back to all the petty things in my life that I spent hours if not days stressing over, just to look back and realize how it was merely a waste of time and never really mattered in the big picture. Life is so short, so live! Live every day as if it’s your last. No regrets.”
