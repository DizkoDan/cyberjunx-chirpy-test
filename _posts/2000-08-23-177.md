Got both hard drivez reformatted and partitioned in the web server. I donâ€™t know that you will notice anything client-side, it was done mainly to re-allocate disk space from old partitions to give more to the ones that were starting to hurt. I also setup a caching nameserver last night. Now I just need to take the time to model our firewall, since the server is built and ready to go. Time to go get some food.
