## How to install a custom kernel

<font color="red">\* Requires root</font>

Installing a kernel is done exactly the same way as installing a ROM, only you don’t need to wipe data, but it is recommended to wipe the cache. The most popular kernels are the [Hydra kernels](http://hydrakernel.cz.cc/), [Incredikernel](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=848453) &amp; [KiNgxKernels](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=760050).

### Install a kernel using ClockworkMod Recovery

First, make sure you have a good [Nandroid backup](http://www.cyberjunx.com/blog/android/hacking/nandroid-backups/), and Titanum Backups of all your data that you care about.

Next download your kernel to the root of your SD card.

[Reboot into Recovery](http://www.cyberjunx.com/blog/android/hacking/recovery/)

Select “install zip from SD card”

Select your Kernel, and it will begin installing.


### Install a kernel using ROM Manger

Make Titanum Backups of all your data that you care about.

Download your kernel to your SD card (You can also download some kernels directly from within ROM Manager)

Open ROM Manager

Select “Install ROM from SD card”

Select your kernel

Check only the backup option DO NOT wipe data

Your phone will reboot into recovery and start installing the kernel immediately.
