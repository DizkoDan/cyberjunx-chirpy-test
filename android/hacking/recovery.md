Booting into recovery mode is simple, and can be done one of 3 ways.

2. Physically
 Simply power down your phone. Once shutdown, hold the **Volume Down** &amp; **Power** buttons at the same time. Select recovery from the menu, by using the **Volume Down** button to move down, and the **Power** button to select.

4. Using adb
 With your phone connected to the computer, Open a cmd prompt on your computer. cd into your sdk/tools directory. Type **adb reboot recovery**

6. Using a reboot application
 I like [Quick Boot](http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.siriusapplications.quickboot) for this.
