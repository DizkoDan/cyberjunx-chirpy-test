Nandroid is a tool that can backup your FULL system. Think of it as a raw snapshot of your device, similar to a ghost image if you are familiar with that. This is an excellent way to keep full state in time backups once you have a particular ROM tweaked the way you like it. Once you start playing with other ROMS, you’ll find you may not like one, or it doesn’t work quite right. It’s always nice to be able to easily revert to a known good backup.

The normal way to do a nandroid backup is as follows.

1. [Boot into recovery](http://www.cyberjunx.com/blog/android/hacking/recovery/)  
2. Navigate to the nandroid menu (note that you can use your trackpad instead of the volume buttons to navigate in Recovery).  
3. Select Backup 
You can also do nandroid backups using [ROM Manager](http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.koushikdutta.rommanager)

1. Open Rom Manager 2\. Select Backup Current ROM

3\. Click OK.

4\. Your phone will automatically reboot and start the nandriod backup, then reboot into the OS when finished.

Restores are done in the same way.


1. [Boot into recovery](http://www.cyberjunx.com/blog/android/hacking/recovery/)
