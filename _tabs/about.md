# About me

Hi there!

My name is Dan, and this is my personal web space. I am a systems engineer by trade, and an all around tech nerd. Outside of my day job, I run a small web services business called [serve-you.net](https://serve-you.net). I tinker with various other tech stuff constantly. I'm a father of 2 boys, a big beer geek, DIYer, shade tree mechanic, and lover of all things music.

It's kind of a mess here, because this site has been carried over from multiple platforms for over 20 years!?!?! I honestly can't even remember where I started it from. I do know that it contains posts from way back in the LiveJournal days, twitter, and various other posting tools I used over the years. I have been running it on WordPress for a number of years, but am now making the switch to a static site, because I don't want or need all the extra cruft that WordPress provides. Expect to find a lot of broken things. Some of which will be fixed, others... probably not.
